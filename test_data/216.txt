<location>WASHINGTON</location> — Senate Democrats on Tuesday blocked a federal spending bill that would have provided $1.1 billion to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus, saying Republicans had sabotaged the legislation with politically charged provisions.The move raised the possibility that no new money would be available soon to fight the disease as Southern states brace for a summer outbreak.The stalemate, accompanied by a sharp war of words on the Senate floor, raised the prospect that the partisan divide in Congress was hindering the government’s ability to respond effectively to a pressing public health emergency.Democrats said they blocked the bill because Republicans were using the must-pass legislation to score political points, jam through unpalatable policy changes and cut money from other programs, including provisions that would hinder access to contraception for women and weaken environmental restrictions on pesticide use.Republicans, in turn, accused Democrats of manufacturing excuses for blocking the bill, but they did not dispute that some of the provisions favored Republican policy positions.Democrats and the White House have been pushing since February for the Republican majorities in Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency financing to fight Zika, which can cause brain damage and other serious defects in infants born to infected mothers.The Democrats reacted with disbelief on Tuesday as Republicans tried to turn the tables and blame Democrats for delaying the money because they had blocked the legislation.“We have a public health crisis descending on our country,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of <location>Kentucky</location> and the majority leader, said after the vote.“Pregnant women all across <location>America</location> are looking at this with dismay, utter dismay, as we sit here in a partisan gridlock manufactured by the other side.” The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of <location>Nevada</location>, was incensed.“I don’t know what universe my friend is living in,” Mr. Reid said, referring to Mr. McConnell.“What does he think?Does he think we’re all stupid?The American people are dumb?” The sniping continued as Senator John Cornyn of <location>Texas</location>, the No.2 Republican, declared, “Our Democratic friends block it because they are sore losers.” Public health officials reacted with their own dismay at the breakdown on Capitol Hill.“If we don’t get new money, we won’t be able to do things at a pace that is necessary and appropriate to the urgency of this threat,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is working on three potential vaccines against the Zika virus and overseeing a study of thousands of pregnant women infected with the virus.In May, the Senate approved $1.1 billion in funding after months of partisan brinkmanship, during which the Obama administration ultimately redirected nearly $600 million previously approved to fight the Ebola virus so that federal health agencies could get a start on working against the Zika virus.House Republicans, in turn, adopted legislation providing $622 million, with most of the money cut and redirected from other federal programs — a move opposed by Democrats who said the money for Zika should be treated as an emergency expenditure.Ultimately, Democrats were willing to go along with the Senate version, but in talks controlled strictly by Republicans, House and Senate negotiators agreed last week to provide $1.1 billion, with $750 million in cuts and policy changes.
