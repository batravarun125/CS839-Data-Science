 URL: http:www.nytimes.com20160630artsmusicviolinists-attempted-murder-charge-is-dropped.html The most serious charges against the violinist Stefan Arzberger, who had been accused of trying to strangle a fellow guest in a Midtown hotel, were dismissed Wednesday in <location>New York</location> State Supreme Court in <location>Manhattan.</location>  Mr. Arzberger, who had faced a charge of attempted murder, instead pleaded guilty to a less serious charge of reckless assault in the third degree, and was given an unconditional discharge. He faces no jail time or fine. The decision leaves Mr. Arzberger, a violinist for the <location>Leipzig</location> String Quartet whose passport was confiscated, free to return home to <location>Germany</location> after a 15-month ordeal. Mr. Arzberger, 43, had been accused of barging naked into the room of a 64-year-old woman at the <location>Hudson</location> Hotel, where he was staying while on tour in March 2015, and trying to strangle her. But his lawyers said he had been drugged by a prostitute who Mr. Arzberger had brought to his room earlier the same night and who they later learned was a man. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass told the court that his office had agreed to drop the most serious charges for a number of reasons including a lack of discernible motive for the alleged attack, and the wishes of the victim, who prosecutors said had not objected to the decision. Mr. Arzberger, who lives in <location>Germany</location>, was forced to stay in the <location>United States</location> while the charges were pending. His lawyer, Nicholas Kaizer, could not say what his immediate plans were. Mr. Arzberger still faces a civil suit brought by the woman, Pamela Robinson, of Asheville, <location>N.C.</location>  In a statement, Mr. Arzberger’s publicist said that the musician “is very pleased with the outcome of this case and looks forward to moving forward with his life.”
