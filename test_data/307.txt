He said, for example, that he had forced her to use the term “radical Islamic terrorism.” And he took credit for pressuring Mrs. Clinton to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, though at the time she faced far greater pressure from a primary challenge on the left, from Senator Bernie Sanders of <location>Vermont</location>.Mr. Trump’s speech drew rebukes from two sides: The Clinton campaign attacked his credibility as a critic of free trade, and deployed Senator Sherrod Brown of <location>Ohio</location>, a populist Democrat who is viewed as a potential running mate for Mrs. Clinton, to accuse Mr. Trump of hypocrisy.“With all of his personal experience profiting from making products overseas, Trump’s the perfect expert to talk about outsourcing,” Mr. Brown said, reciting a list of Trump products, from suits to picture frames, that he said were made in other countries.“We know just in my state alone where Donald Trump could have gone to make these things,” he added.Mr. Trump also drew a cold response from traditionally Republican-leaning interests for his heated attacks on international trade agreements.The Chamber of Commerce, which spends millions of dollars in federal elections, almost entirely in support of Republican candidates, criticized Mr. Trump’s speech on Twitter and claimed that his policies would hurt the economy.“Even under best-case scenario, Trump’s tariffs would strip us of at least 3.5 million jobs,” the group wrote in one Twitter message.For Mr. Trump, who has shifted and doubled back on high-profile policy pronouncements, trade has been a rare area of consistency in the 2016 race.At nearly every campaign rally, Mr. Trump has knocked trade deals with <location>China</location> as unfair to the American worker so frequently as to make his percussive pronunciation of <location>China</location> a hallmark of impersonators.Mr. Trump appeared in his speech to pre-empt criticism from economists and business groups that have argued his policy proposals would lead to a damaging trade war with <location>China</location> and perhaps other countries.“We already have a trade war,” Mr. Trump told the crowd, departing from his prepared remarks.“And we’re losing, badly.” Mr. Trump, who has struggled for months to win support from the conservative business community, also attended a fund-raiser in <location>West Virginia</location> on Tuesday hosted by a coal executive, Robert E. Murray.It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will stick closely to the trade-focused message he delivered in <location>Pennsylvania</location>.At an evening rally in eastern <location>Ohio</location>, he returned to a familiar set of red-meat themes, calling for a wall on the Mexican border and reiterating his vow to waterboard Islamic State terrorists.But to win that state in November, Mr. Trump hopes to outflank Mrs. Clinton with economically distressed voters who may have voted Democratic in the past, and trade remains an issue that stirs up voters across party lines.In a nod to potential crossover voters, Mr. Trump at one point on Tuesday quoted Mr. Sanders by name in criticizing Mrs. Clinton.Though he dwelled at greatest length in <location>Pennsylvania</location> on what he described as the damaging economic consequences of globalization, Mr. Trump also laced his remarks with broader nationalist language, arguing that the <location>United States</location> would lose its sovereignty and national pride by negotiating too freely with the world.“They get the expansion.We get the joblessness,” Mr. Trump said of trade deals with foreign countries.“That’s the way it works — not going to happen anymore.”
