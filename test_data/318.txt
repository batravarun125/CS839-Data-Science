The first, brought about by the Depression of the 1930s, ended an era in which governments bowed to the gospel of the gold standard and were expected to butt out of the battles between labor and capital, letting markets function on their own, whatever the consequences.In his 2010 book, “Capitalism 4.0,” the <location>London</location> based economic commentator Anatole Kaletsky refers to a document in the archive of the British Treasury that shows the reaction of the permanent secretary to a proposal by the great economist John Maynard Keynes to use government spending to spur <location>Britain’s</location> economy.It has three words: “Extravagance, Inflation, Bankruptcy.” Mr. Keynes’s views ultimately prevailed, though, providing the basis for a new post-World War II orthodoxy favoring active government intervention in the economy and a robust welfare state.But that era ended when skyrocketing oil prices and economic mismanagement in the 1970s brought about a combination of inflation and unemployment that fatally undermined people’s trust in the state.Even the former president of <location>France</location> François Mitterrand — a Socialist who nationalized the banking system, increased government employment and raised public-sector pay after being elected in 1981 — was forced into a U-turn.In 1983, he froze the budget and brought about “la rigueur”: the austerity.The Keynesian era ended when Thatcher and Reagan rode onto the scene with a version of capitalism based on tax cuts, privatization and deregulation that helped revive their engines of growth but led the workers of the world to the deeply frustrating, increasingly unequal economy of today.There are potentially constructive approaches to set the world economy on a more promising path.For starters, what about taking advantage of rock-bottom interest rates to tap the world’s excess funds to build and repair a fraying public infrastructure?That would employ legions of blue-collar workers and help increase economic growth, which has been only inching ahead across much of the industrialized world.After the Brexit vote, Lawrence Summers, former Treasury secretary under President Clinton and one of President Obama’s top economic advisers at the nadir of the Great Recession, laid out an argument for what he called “responsible nationalism,” which focused squarely on the interests of domestic workers.Instead of negotiating more agreements to ease business across borders, governments would focus on deals to improve labor and environmental standards internationally.They might cut deals to prevent cross-border tax evasion.There is, however, little evidence that the world’s leaders will go down that path.Despite the case for economic stimulus, austerity still rules across much of the West.<location>Europe</location> has most governments have imposed stringent budget cuts — ensuring that all but the strongest economies would stall.In the <location>United States,</location> political polarization has brought fiscal policy — spending and taxes — to a standstill.The cost of inaction could be enormous.Mr. Johnson’s campaign to reject British membership of the European Union is already producing political and economic shock waves around the world.Mr. Trump — whose solutions include punishing <location>China</location> with high tariffs and building a wall with <location>Mexico</location> — is trying to ride workers’ angst into the most powerful job in the world.There are less catastrophic ways to put an end to an era.
