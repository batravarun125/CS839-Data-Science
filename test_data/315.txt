“The No.1 thing they’ve been telling us to get better at is navigation,” Mr. Kunins said.In the past, someone using a Kindle device or app who wanted to save their place could bookmark a page, which works well enough but can get disorienting if you have digitally dog-eared a lot of pages.With Page Flip, Kindle automatically saves the page you’re reading when you tap the screen of your device, pinning it to the side of the screen.You can also easily shift the book to what Amazon calls a bird’s-eye view, which shows thumbnail images of a handful of pages at once so you can skim quickly to find the reference page you’re looking for.Here’s an Amazon promotional video of how it will work: There has been much chatter in the publishing industry about slowing e-book sales and the unexpected vitality of print book sales.Amazon is notoriously stingy with data about many of its businesses, but it is eager to convey that the Kindle business is still growing.Mr. Kunins said that 2015 was a record year for the Kindle business at Amazon; customers bought more Kindle books and read more of their pages than ever before.He said the company had paid more than $160 million in royalties over the last 12 months to independent authors who participated in Kindle Unlimited, a $10-a-month digital reading service (the company didn’t provide comparable data for the year before).“Kindle keeps growing year after year,” he said.
