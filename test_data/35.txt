 URL: http:www.nytimes.com20160630worldaustraliaqueensland-mining-political-donations.html <location>SYDNEY</location> — Political donations by mining companies preceded legislative approval for several Australian mining operations, including plans to develop the country’s biggest coal mine, according to a report by an independent Australian policy institute released on Thursday. The report, by the <location>Australia</location> Institute, examined six cases where mining companies made donations to <location>Australia’s</location> major political parties and received favorable legislation for mining projects in the state of <location>Queensland</location>. The report contends that the donations from the mining industry bought access to <location>Queensland</location> state officials, giving the industry an “undue influence on our democratic processes” and resulting in decisions that “have poor outcomes for our environment, economy and our communities.” “Taking money from mining companies undermines the integrity of political decision-making,” Mark Ogge, the report’s co-author said in an interview. “It should be illegal. It is a conflict of interest.” The report, written with the Australian Conservation Foundation, was released two days before <location>Australia’s</location> national elections, which are Saturday. While the timing appears intended to highlight the influence of the mining industry in politics — <location>Australia’s</location> campaign finance laws do not require disclosure of donations to major parties until months after the fact — the report does not refer to any contributions in the current election. The report’s primary focus is on the Liberal National Party, led by Campbell Newman, which governed <location>Queensland</location> from 2012 to 2015, and his successor, Annastacia Palaszczuk, of the Labor Party, who took office there in 2015. <location>Queensland</location> is home to several large and contentious mining projects, including in the <location>Galilee Basin</location> in central <location>Queensland</location>. Two new mines there could add an additional 120 million tons a year to <location>Australia’s</location> thermal coal exports. One of the mines would be Australia’s largest and, environmentalists say, will damage the Great Barrier Reef. The project’s developer, the Adani Group, a conglomerate based in <location>India</location>, donated $52,139 to the Queensland Liberal National Party and to the federal Liberal Party of <location>Australia</location>, from 2012 to 2015, the report said. The report said Adani officials met with Anthony Lynham, the state’s minister for natural resources and mines, at least seven times and had 12 other meetings with state ministers in 2013 and 2014. In late 2014, the government of <location>Queensland</location> agreed to invest up to $220 million in rail and port projects to support the new mine. It also changed the legislation to remove the right of the community to object to mining projects, the report said. The Adani project was approved by Ms. Palaszczuk’s government, and included a plan approved by the federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, a Liberal Party member, to allow bigger coal ships to dock at the port of <location>Abbot Point</location> within the Great Barrier Reef on <location>Queensland’s</location> northeast coast. The plan called for the dredging of the port to accommodate larger ships, with the spoils dumped near the reef. After an outcry from scientists and legal action by conservationists, the dredging decision was reversed. The dredge spoils will now be dumped on land. But the report said Adani’s donations had “influenced the approval process, encouraging successive governments to ignore concerns regarding their suitability to operate.” Ms. Palaszczuk defended her government’s actions, saying it had lowered the reporting requirement for political donations to $738 from $9,458, making government more transparent. And in a written statement, a spokesman for the <location>Queensland</location> government said it had restored laws to allow communities to weigh in on proposed mining projects. The spokesman said the approval process for mining projects was extensive and transparent. It includes public consultation, environmental impact studies and strict conditions to protect the environment. Mine lease applications must also meet public interest requirements. The mines minister for <location>Queensland</location>, Anthony Lynham, was on vacation and was not available for comment. Adnani officials did not respond to a request for comment. The Adani case was just one example cited in the report. Two oil companies, Beach Energy and Linc Energy, and the mining companies Karreman Quarries and New Hope Coal also made donations, according to the report, which says the companies received favorable treatment in return. Another company, Sibelco, spent money campaigning to support its sand mining operations ahead of the state election. A spokeswoman for Sibelco, Helen Stanley, said the company had made no direct donations to political parties but had funded an electorate campaign in support of its sand mining operations on <location>North Stradbroke Island.</location> She said the campaign was run in 2013. In 2015, the <location>Palaszczuk</location> government said it would end sand mining on the island by 2019. Beach Energy, Karreman Quarries and New Hope Coal did not respond to questions. Linc Energy is in receivership, a company spokeswoman said, adding she could not answer questions about the company’s political donations policy. Over all, the report said, the <location>Queensland</location> Liberal National Party received more than $700,000 in donations from mining companies from 2011 to 2015. The mining industry also donated nearly $2.2 million to the federal Liberal Party of <location>Australia</location>, which now leads the national government, in the five years since July 2011. The <location>Queensland</location> Liberal National Party and the Liberal Party of <location>Australia</location> are not one and the same.
