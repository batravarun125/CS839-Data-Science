Analysts at Kelley Blue Book estimate that the cost of buying back all the offending diesels would be $7.3 billion.Volkswagen also owes owners additional compensation of $5,100 to $10,000, or at least another $2.4 billion.Another big uncertainty is Volkswagen’s fix for the problem.VW owners can have the company retool the emissions systems.But the company has not yet come up with solutions that pass regulatory muster — and it is unclear what they will cost Volkswagen.While they would improve emissions, any fixes might not also make the cars fully compliant with American rules and could create more challenges for already frustrated car owners.George Farquar, a plaintiff named in the consumers’ suit, said he was interested in getting his 2010 Volkswagen Jetta TDI fixed.Mr. Farquar said he had reluctantly continued to drive his Jetta, even though he thinks he “gets nasty looks from every Prius car that passes.” But he said he worried that the eventual fix would require him to drive to the dealer more frequently for maintenance, defeating the purpose of a cleaner car.Even now, he said, “many things aren’t clear.” Then there is the issue of what Volkswagen will do with all the cars it buys back from owners in the <location>United States.</location> The settlement bars Volkswagen from simply exporting the cars, without fixes, to countries with less-stringent emissions standards.“We are not shipping the air pollution elsewhere,” Gina McCarthy, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, said on Tuesday, noting that Volkswagen was required to fix the cars that it bought back or scrap them.Volkswagen representatives portrayed the settlement as a good deal for the company under the circumstances.“It would have been counterproductive for Volkswagen to engage in a multiyear, grind-it-out litigation with the <location>U.S.</location> government, 50 states and private plaintiffs,” said Robert J. Giuffra Jr., a lawyer with the firm Sullivan & Cromwell who represented Volkswagen.But the swell of scrutiny worldwide will only add to the financial pressure.German prosecutors are looking into whether Volkswagen and top executives, including the former chief executive Martin Winterkorn, waited too long to inform shareholders about the looming scandal.Investors are also suing Volkswagen over similar disclosure issues.Volkswagen faces an inquiry by attorneys general in 42 states, the district of <location>Columbia</location> and <location>Puerto Rico</location>.Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of <location>New York</location>, one of the states leading the investigation, announced on Tuesday the states’ own settlement with Volkswagen for $500 million in penalties for defrauding consumers.A separate investigation by the state attorneys general into possible environmental misconduct by Volkswagen is continuing.In addition, the criminal investigation of Volkswagen in the <location>United States</location> looms large.Senators Edward J. Markey of <location>Massachusetts</location> and Richard Blumenthal of <location>Connecticut</location>, both Democrats and members of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, pressed authorities for further action.“We continue to call on the Department of Justice to vigorously pursue its criminal investigation,” they said in a joint statement.“All the facts point to criminal culpability, and officials should be held accountable as appropriate.” Volkswagen’s credibility with investors, already strained, could deteriorate further if the company is forced to increase the money it has set aside for diesel-related costs.Shares of Volkswagen are down more than 20 percent since the scandal erupted late last year.And the deception itself has been a major drag on sales.Never fabulously profitable, the company reported a record loss in 2015, while earnings and sales declined in the first quarter of 2016.Volkswagen is also trying to quell a potential backlash by dealers in the <location>United States.</location>  The carmaker is facing a lawsuit filed by the owner of three dealerships, seeking compensation for lost sales suffered by the more than 600 dealers in the <location>United States</location>.Separately, a group of dealers has been trying to work with Volkswagen to win financial support.“As dealers, we are very anxious to get a settlement,” said Wade Walker, owner of a Volkswagen dealership in <location>Montpelier</location>.“We’re customers, too — of Volkswagen — and we’ve been hurt in this process, tremendously.”
