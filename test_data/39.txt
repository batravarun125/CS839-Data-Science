Noxious gas: From some dire beauty headlines of late, you’d think the very air was contriving, if not to kill us, then to make us look older. Scientists are just beginning to uncover how toxic air affects the skin’s aging process. A study done this year on data from subjects in <location>Germany</location> and <location>China</location> appeared to link increased air pollution to brown spots on the skin. And not surprisingly, the big beauty players are stepping in with new skin care products — “pollution protection,” as it’s called. So what exactly are we protecting ourselves against? Ozone, the toxic gas formed when UV light hits mono-nitrogen oxides (basically, combustion exhaust), is suspected by some to be one of the primary causes of pollution-related skin damage. (Ozone in the stratosphere absorbs UV rays, and so is protective against skin cancer. But ground-level ozone has been linked to respiratory problems.) We are continuously exposed to ozone, said Dr. Giuseppe Valacchi, an associate professor in physiology at the Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology at the University of <location>Ferrara</location> in <location>Italy</location>, who is known for his expertise on pollution’s effect on the body. “It’s as if ozone were designed specifically to injure our skin.” The outer layer of our skin contains lipids — that is, fats that bind skin cells together. Ozone oxidizes those lipids, Dr. Valacchi said, causing inflammation, breaking down the barrier function of the skin and activating a cascade of DNA-damaging events. What to do? “You can protect yourself from UV damage with sunscreen, but sunscreens aren’t effective for pollution,” said Dr. Gilly Munavalli, medical director of Dermatology, Laser & Vein Specialists of the <location>Carolinas</location> in <location>Charlotte</location>, <location>N.C</location>.
