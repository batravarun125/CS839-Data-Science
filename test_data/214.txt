Shaken by Britain’s vote to quit the European Union, the bloc’s leaders met on Tuesday in <location>Brussels</location> and sent a blunt message to <location>Britain</location> and others tempted to follow its example: Bolting will carry a heavy price.While softening demands that <location>Britain</location> formally file for divorce swiftly following last Thursday’s shocking referendum result, leaders of the European Union’s 27 other nations made it clear to Prime Minister David Cameron that his country would not enjoy the benefits of membership — like access to <location>Europe’s</location> single market — while sloughing off its burdens.Chancellor Angela Merkel of <location>Germany</location>, speaking at a late-night news conference, took a hard position, saying that her country would defend its economic priorities and that <location>Britain</location> must use an agreed legal procedure to leave the European Union.“The discussion today reflected very clearly that everyone felt this was a sea change, a watershed moment, a historic moment,” Mrs. Merkel said.The goal was to reshape the relationship with <location>Britain</location> “as a relationship of friendship,” she said, but “we will also be guided by our own interests.” Referring to the terrorist attack on Tuesday at <location>Istanbul’s</location> airport, she said a world “characterized by turmoil and turbulences” was “not waiting for the European Union to make up its mind,” an apparent reference to uncertainty over its relations with <location>Britain</location> and the future direction of what began as a peace project after World War II and has since grown into the world’s biggest economic bloc.Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the <location>Netherlands</location>, historically one of <location>Britain’s</location> closest allies in pushing <location>Europe</location> to focus on strengthening market forces and protecting sovereign rights, said the economic and political mayhem caused by Britain’s vote to leave should deter others.“To everybody thinking of leaving the single market, this is what happens,” he said.The turmoil has stirred hope in some quarters that <location>Britain</location> might, in the end, never take the next, formal step to leave the European Union.Ms. Merkel, however, dismissed this as “impossible.” As to whether <location>Britain</location> could hold another referendum with a different outcome, she said that was highly unlikely.“As of tonight I do not see any possibility to reverse this decision,” she said.“It is not the hour for wishful thinking.” Mr. Cameron, attending what will probably be his last European summit meeting in <location>Brussels</location>, also stressed that there was no turning back from last week’s vote in favor of Brexit, as Britain’s withdrawal from the union is known.“I am sorry we lost the referendum but you have to accept the result of the British people, you have to accept the verdict,” he told reporters.“I’m a democrat.” While calling for “the closest possible relationship” with <location>Europe</location> in the future, he acknowledged that “it is impossible to have all of the benefits of membership without some of the costs of membership.” Mr. Cameron, who has said he will resign by October, has left the task of setting the terms of the departure settlement to his successor, who will be responsible for invoking an exit clause, Article 50, in a European treaty and starting negotiations with <location>Brussels</location> on disentangling a formal relationship that began in 1973.<location>France</location> and other countries have complained that this would only create months of uncertainty and stoke unease for financial markets.But there seemed to be more sympathy on Tuesday for <location>Britain’s</location> hesitant pace.“If they need more time we have to wait.This is the only legal way we have,” Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which represents European governments, told reporters.Beyond dealing with the mechanics of Britain’s exit, however, European Union members face an even tougher challenge in trying to dampen rising populist sentiment elsewhere, while somehow rebuilding the cornerstone of <location>Europe</location> peace and relative prosperity for more than 60 years.
