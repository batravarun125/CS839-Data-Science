 Volkswagen solved one big problem stemming from its diesel emissions deception, agreeing on Tuesday to pay up to $14.7 billion to settle claims in the <location>United States.</location>  But the final financial toll — once the company deals with a long list of fines, lawsuits and criminal investigations around the world — may well be far higher.The continuing fallout could leave Volkswagen vulnerable to billions of dollars more in expenses at a time when profit is already under pressure.So far, Volkswagen has set aside 16.2 billion euros, or about $17.9 billion, for costs related to its public admission last September that its supposed “clean diesel” cars had been deliberately designed to cheat on air-quality tests.Matthias Müller, Volkswagen’s chief executive, said less than two weeks ago that the amount was adequate.But the American settlement with the government and car owners will consume a big chunk of that money.And Volkswagen faces even more scrutiny in the <location>United States</location> and around the world, most notably as authorities pursue criminal investigations.The Volkswagen scandal is “one of the most flagrant violations of environmental and consumer laws,” Sally Q. Yates, deputy attorney general of the <location>United States</location>, said at a news conference in <location>Washington</location> on Tuesday.“We can’t suck the nitrous oxide out of the air,” Ms. Yates said.But the settlement, she said, would help repair some of the damage.The deal, in which Volkswagen did not admit to wrongdoing, includes $10.03 billion to buy back affected cars at their prescandal values and pay additional cash compensation to owners.Additionally, the company has agreed to put $2.7 billion into a government fund to compensate for the environmental impact of the cars and to spend $2 billion on cleaner-vehicle projects.“This is by no means the last step,” Ms. Yates cautioned.“The settlements do not address any potential criminal liability.” She said the <location>United States</location> was aggressively pursuing a criminal investigation of the company and individuals.Volkswagen said the settlement was covered by the money already set aside, though it did not rule out the possibility of allocating more.“Today’s announcement is within the scope of our provisions,” Frank Witter, Volkswagen’s chief financial officer, said in a statement.“We are in a position to manage the consequences.” One big risk to the carmaker is in <location>Europe</location>.The American deal focuses on nearly 500,000 Volkswagen vehicles.But the carmaker admitted to installing the cheating device on more than 11 million cars worldwide, with 8.5 million in <location>Europe</location>.European legal systems do not favor consumers as much as those in the <location>United States</location> do.And the emissions rules in the region are more lenient than in the <location>United States</location>, which will make it harder for European owners to pursue claims.Still, Volkswagen may have to pay up.There is an increasing outcry from European owners and politicians for compensation.“Now that this is done, attention should turn to <location>Europe</location>,” said Michael Hausfeld, a lawyer whose firm represents aggrieved owners and shareholders on both sides of the <location>Atlantic</location>.The settlement “is a strong foundation for what Volkswagen needs to do for European owners as well as for the environment.” In addition, it may not be clear for many months how much Volkswagen will ultimately have to pay to American car owners.A maximum of around $10 billion has been allocated in the settlement.The actual cost to Volkswagen will depend on how many owners exercise their option to sell their cars back to the company at the prescandal value, which will vary according to the age and mileage of the cars.The Federal Trade Commission said consumers could expect to get from roughly $12,500 for an older-model Jetta to as much as $44,000 for a 2014 Audi.The settlement works out to about $21,000 a car.If Volkswagen is lucky, the total paid to car owners could turn out to be less than $10 billion.
