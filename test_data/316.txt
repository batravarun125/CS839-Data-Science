In 2013, the company received a subpoena from Mr. Schneiderman for statistics about who used the platform and what they used it for.Airbnb initially resisted, but agreed to provide an anonymized version of the data a year later.During the public fight with Mr. Schneiderman, Airbnb also tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a behind-the-scenes deal with the attorney general and the city’s power brokers, and it made influential enemies along the way.The company alienated the powerful Hotel Trades Council, an influential hotel union, by offering a deal to a service workers union that held out the possibility that Airbnb hosts would use unionized apartment cleaners, according to two people with knowledge of the offer who spoke on condition of anonymity.The <location>Silicon Valley</location> venture capitalist and Airbnb investor Ron Conway made matters worse when, after donating to Bill de Blasio’s mayoral campaign, he flew to <location>New York</location> and told Mr. deBlasio and business leaders to follow <location>San Francisco’s</location> example or fall behind in innovation and growth, according to people who attended one of the meetings.That message was not well received.In response, Mr. Conway said in an email that <location>New York</location> “won’t even entertain a real conversation” about innovation and the city in the process has become “its own worse enemy.” Airbnb has since tried to appease the city with millions of dollars in hotel taxes.But the tax payments, which are paid by hosts, not Airbnb, would essentially legitimize the hosts’ illegal rentals, argued Liz Krueger, a <location>New York</location> city state senator who has pushed to remove illegal Airbnb listings.Airbnb released more data in December in a bridge-building effort, but it required lawmakers to make appointments to read a physical copy of the information at a location in <location>New York</location> chosen by Airbnb.It was a bit like making a library appointment to inspect a rare book.“People could stay for as long as they wanted,” said Chris Lehane, Airbnb’s head of public policy.Lawmakers said they thought it was an insult.Mr. Lehane said it was a privacy measure, though the data was anonymous.Political leaders, unions, landlords and housing activists devised a way to deter illegal rentals on Airbnb.Cognizant of the Communications Decency Act that Airbnb is citing in its <location>San Francisco</location> lawsuit, lawmakers drafted the recently approved bill to fine the hosts up to $7,500 if they are caught listing an illegal rental.“We had to become the enforcers because Airbnb would not do it,” said state Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, an architect of the legislation.Mr. Lehane counters that the bill is an attack on “the heart of Airbnb’s core business.” The bill has not yet been sent to Gov.Andrew M. Cuomo and a time frame for that is not clear.Once he receives it, he has 10 days to veto it or let it become law.Now <location>New York</location> and Airbnb are at an impasse.Airbnb rejects city’s housing laws and will not compromise unless it can help rewrite them.Politicians say they will come to the table after Airbnb removes all illegal listings.In Airbnb’s defense, Mr. Lehane said that <location>New York</location> city is the only major American city that has not worked with Airbnb to create friendlier laws.And Airbnb could someday strike a working relationship with <location>New York</location> city lawmakers and power brokers.“We haven’t been perfect and we’ve learned a lot,” Mr. Lehane said.
