Michelle Obama began a visit to <location>Africa</location> on Monday with a stop at a leadership camp for girls in <location>Liberia</location>, where she urged teenagers in one of the world’s poorest countries to keep fighting to stay in school. With her own teenage daughters joining her, Mrs. Obama told the girls in the camp that she was “just so thrilled to be here with you.” “I’m here to shine a big bright light on you,” she said. Education for girls is the central theme of the first lady’s trip, which also includes stops in <location>Morocco</location> and <location>Spain</location>. She was welcomed on her arrival in <location>Liberia</location> with a red carpet and traditional dancers. In connection with the visit, the Agency for International Development announced up to $27 million in funding in <location>Liberia</location> for Let Girls Learn, an initiative introduced by Mrs. Obama and President Obama last year. The first lady is traveling with her mother and daughters Malia, 17, who recently graduated from high school, and Sasha, 15. <location>Liberia</location> was battered by civil wars between 1989 and 2003. Ebola swept the country in 2014, killing more than 4,800 people and forcing schools to be closed for months. The country, founded as part of an effort to resettle freed American slaves, has deep ties to the <location>United States</location>. The country’s oldest vocational high school, in Kakata, is named for the civil rights activist Booker T. The school suspended midterm exams, which had been scheduled to start on Monday, “to allow the students to give Mrs. Obama a rousing welcome to appreciate what the <location>United States</location> has done for us,” said Harris Tarnue, the principal. “She will be a real inspiration to the young girls around here,” he said. As first lady, Mrs. Obama has previously visited <location>Senegal</location>, <location>Africa</location> and <location>Tanzania</location>.
