<location>SEATTLE</location> — For years, Amazon has been chiseling away at the irritants that keep many people from switching to e-readers.The company has improved the legibility of the text on Kindle screens to make it nearly indistinguishable from print, and fiddled with the ergonomics of the new Kindle Oasis to make using it feel more like holding a book.On Tuesday, Amazon will make a small change to its Kindle software that could solve a vexing issue for people who prefer the intuitiveness of navigating a print book.The update to the software for Amazon’s own Kindle devices as well as apps that run on iOS and Android will include a feature called Page Flip that effectively mimics the near-universal habit of using a thumb to temporarily mark the page of a printed book where the reader left off.The update will be available free on Tuesday.Page Flip is designed for those moments when you’re reading and need to quickly glance at another section of a book with photographs, maps or family trees.This is especially useful for nonfiction, but also comes in handy for books like “A Game of Thrones” that feature large casts of characters who inhabit a bewildering array of fictional lands.In a recent demonstration of Page Flip, Jeff Kunins, vice president for Kindle Reader at Amazon, says the company regularly surveys people with Kindle devices and software to find out how to improve them.Readers of nonfiction have been clear about where they’d like to see changes.
