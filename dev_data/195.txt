<location>England</location> — Andy Murray is the only British man to win the Wimbledon singles title since 1936.Last year he led <location>Britain</location> to its first Davis Cup championship since 1936.He has been figurehead and head cheerleader for British tennis for most of his career.Before Tuesday, Murray had never faced another British player.In fact, he had not played a fellow Briton in a tour-level match until he defeated Aljaz Bedene and Kyle Edmund this month on his way to winning the tournament at <location>Queen’s</location> club.His opponent Tuesday was Liam Broady, a 22-year-old ranked 235th whom Murray knows well and with whom he has practiced.But friendship and patriotic camaraderie only go so far after the first ball is hit.Murray, the No.2 seed, was ruthless once the match began.He won the first three games and 14 of the first 15 points on his way to a 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 victory.“As much as I was saying it’s just another guy on the other side of the court in the run-up to the match, that I’m just going to focus on hitting the tennis ball, you’re still playing Andy Murray on Centre Court,” Broady said.“It’s very hard to get your head around that.” Still, Broady said he thought he would be a lot more nervous than he was.“I felt at home from the start,” he said.“I didn’t play like I was at home from the start, but I certainly felt like it.” Fifteen British players, many given wild cards, were in the singles draws, including nine men, the most since 2006.Four have advanced to the second round, with the highest-ranked British women, Johanna Konta and Heather Watson, yet to complete their first-round matches after play was suspended in the afternoon because of rain.Tara Moore, a 23-year-old British wild card ranked 227th, won her first main-draw match at a Grand Slam tournament, defeating Alison van Uytvanck, 6-3, 6-2.Moore was born in <location>Hong Kong</location> and grew up in the <location>United States</location>, training at Nick Bollettieri’s tennis academy.But she has lived in <location>England</location> in recent years and said she feels “very British.” That includes cheering for her countrymen and women.“I want every British player to do well,” Moore said.“They’re all my friends.I want them to do the best.” At his match, Murray was back in cheerleader mode, too.Broady said Murray asked him if he enjoyed it.“Yeah, of course I did,” Broady said.“I played Andy Murray on Centre Court, what can’t I enjoy?Obviously, I didn’t enjoy the losing part, but it was a great experience.” “Enjoy it” has been Murray’s advice to many fellow Britons.He said it about James Ward before he played No.1 Novak Djokovic on Monday.And Murray said it again Tuesday when asked about Marcus Willis, the 772nd-ranked qualifier who has an appointment with Roger Federer on Centre Court on Wednesday in the second round.
