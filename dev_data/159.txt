<location>WASHINGTON</location> — Under fire from senators in both parties, a senior federal health official told Congress on Tuesday that the Obama administration would adjust its plan to reduce Medicare payments for many prescription drugs, but those assurances did not fully allay deep concerns.The official, Dr. Patrick H. Conway, a deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, indicated to the Senate Finance Committee that the administration would probably go ahead with its proposal in some form, and he promised that officials would try to prevent any harm to patients.That did little to calm bipartisan fears.Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of <location>Iowa</location>, called the administration plan “an ill-conceived experiment” and suggested that it was a form of “human subjects research” for which the government needed the consent of patients.Senator Ron Wyden of <location>Oregon</location>, the committee’s senior Democrat, said he worried that the proposal “could unintentionally drive seniors toward hospitals,” where treatment is typically more costly and less convenient.That left Senator Tim Scott, Republican of <location>South Carolina</location>, to quip that the administration had done a good job bringing Republicans and Democrats together, with both parties hearing from constituents who fear that the cuts in Medicare payments could limit access to treatments.The concerns may be understandable, with drug prices rising and seniors growing anxious, but Dr. Conway said the status quo was unsatisfactory.Patients are often responsible for 20 percent of the cost of extremely expensive medicines under Part B of Medicare, which covers outpatient services.In these cases, he said, patients “may face significant out-of-pocket expenses.” In its proposal, the administration wants to change reimbursement formulas to try to encourage doctors to choose lower-cost therapies.The administration said it wanted to require “mandatory participation” for doctors and hospitals that provide Part B drugs to Medicare beneficiaries in three-fourths of the nation’s 7,000 “primary care service areas,” using reimbursement formulas different from those in the federal Medicare law.For a test, said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of <location>Pennsylvania</location>, that “seems almost universal.” Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of <location>Michigan</location>, agreed.“The scope of the current proposal seems broader than is typical of demonstration projects,” she said.The test is to be conducted under a section of the Affordable Care Act that allows the secretary of health and human services to waive requirements of the Medicare law when trying out new payment models for a specific “defined population.” The administration plan goes far beyond such a demonstration project, Mr. Toomey said.
