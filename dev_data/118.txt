<location>PARIS</location> — The rain began around 8 p.m., as crowds massed in a furious bottleneck at the entrance to Haider Ackermann’s show.The attendees were not pleased.The sky was a moody, Haider Ackermann gray, dense and melancholic, which might have suited Mr. Ackermann, the dense and melancholic Colombian-born designer, were it not the evening of his men’s show, held in the courtyard of the <location>Paris</location> fashion museum.Guests were beckoned inside in twos and threes, to huddle behind the balustrades of the covered arcade, sipping chilled white wine and looking doubtfully at their tarp-coveted seats in the open air.From the backstage entrance, Mr. Ackermann peered through his round glasses, no less perturbed.By 20 minutes after the hour, the drizzle had tapered off and the show could begin.The models slouched their circular course in a parrot-feather palette of pink, purple, orange and green — some in low-slung, droopy trousers; some in higher, tighter pants, their blotchily patterned shirts and scarves hanging loosely about them.The few female models interspersed among them wore mostly black.For Mr. Ackermann, the male wears the radiant plumage.It was an exuberant, over-the-top collection, and all the stronger for its fabulous intensity, with the flashing spotlights and grinding music of a disco alfresco.In the front row, Abe Chabon, 13, pronounced it a hit.“It was incredible,” he said.Abe was attending his first fashion shows in <location>Paris</location> in the company of his father, the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Chabon.Abe is a dedicated follower of fashion — he saves chore wages and his recent bar mitzvah money to buy clothes, and attended the show wearing Raf Simons, Acne Studios and Gosha Rubchinskiy.Mr. Chabon, who confessed no more than a passing interest in fashion, had pitched to GQ the idea of writing about a father-son fashion week trip, the better to understand his son’s fascination.“Little Hypebeast, that’s his nickname,” Mr. Chabon said.
