<location>WASHINGTON</location> — The House Select Committee on <location>Benghazi</location> released its report on Tuesday detailing the attacks in <location>Libya</location> on Sept. 11, 2012, that resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.The Republican-led committee found no evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state.Here is a selection of summarized findings in the report, with fact checks: This criticism is not particularly new.Senior Pentagon officials have consistently said that they were constrained by the “tyranny of time and distance” — that is, that the military could not have sent troops or planes in time to have made a difference.The report and Republican critics have always countered that had the White House and Pentagon acted more swiftly, they might have mitigated the later attack on the compound’s C.I.A.annex.But it is unclear what forces might have made a difference there._____ This sounds like dithering that might have cost American lives.But the uniform swaps reflect the chaos and confusion in sorting out what was going on in <location>Benghazi</location>, and whether American forces should arrive identifiable as <location>United States</location> military personnel or be less noticeable in civilian clothes.Even the report acknowledges the challenges facing the so-called FAST teams: These troops did not have their own planes, which meant delays waiting for flights; did not travel with their own vehicles (they would need to find some in <location>Benghazi</location> when they landed); and were designed to deploy before a crisis hit, not during hostilities._____ This suggests that the Obama administration was not treating the crisis seriously.
