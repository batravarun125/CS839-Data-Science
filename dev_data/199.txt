Palantir Technologies’ $225 million offer to repurchase its employees’ privately held shares hints that <location>Silicon Valley</location> is starting to make some fundamental changes in the way it compensates its workers.Palantir, a data analytics firm, is one of the largest start-ups around, with a valuation reaching more than $20 billion last year.It is offering $7.40 a share to buy back up to 12.5 percent of an employee’s shares (and in some cases, those of former employees), or $500,000 worth of shares, whichever is lower.The offer has some interesting characteristics, to say the least.Palantir’s worth, measured by the price at which its stock trades in the private share market, has been deflated.The price Palantir is offering is above the private market price and the value assigned to the stock by some prominent mutual funds.A critical story by Buzzfeed last month reported that the company was struggling to keep employees and collect on bookings.With the negative news and the general decline in valuations, there is a sentiment that Palantir is no longer the $20 billion behemoth it once was.Morgan Stanley recently marked down the value of Palantir’s shares to $5.92 each from a high of over $11.No one knows if this valuation is right, by the way, because prices in the private market are largely guesses.Palantir’s offer, though, is at least a cheap way to tell the market that Palantir thinks it is still worth a lot.The repurchase comes with conditions, as Buzzfeed reported earlier.Palantir is requiring that current and former employees who sell their shares agree that they will not compete with Palantir for 12 months or solicit any Palantir employees during that time.It also makes them agree to a nondisclosure arrangement that forbids them from even talking about the repurchase and waive any claims they might have against the company.And the offer extends to some but not all former employees.Palantir has said the offer is intended to increase the morale of employees by offering them “liquidity.” Some employees have been with the company since its founding 11 years ago and are still waiting for that pinnacle event in the life of a hot tech start-up: the initial public offering of stock.Unlike them, the former employees can already sell their shares in the private market.They might take this offer because it is a higher amount.Palantir’s motives for including them in the buyback are unclear.Palantir gets all of the benefits of the nondisclosure and other agreements, but any employee who takes the offer is not likely to be doing those things anyway.Perhaps Palantir is doing this out of the goodness of its heart.Whatever the reason, Palantir’s offer comes at a time of great debate in <location>Silicon Valley</location> over employee compensation.Traditionally, workers received options on a four-year vesting schedule.When they left a company, they would have 90 days to exercise those options or forfeit them.In earlier times, this was not much of a problem because companies backed by venture capital went public rather quickly, in some cases before employee shares even vested.But now, the average venture-backed company waits about eight years to go public, creating a headache for employees.Scott Kupor, a managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, highlights the issue in a recent blog post.Basically, employees who leave their jobs now must exercise their options almost immediately.But to do that, they need cash – cash they might not have.Once the former employees exercise their options, the stock they receive is often illiquid and not sellable.
