No one had a precise census of the instruments, but the soundboard receives 110 channels for microphone feeds, each capturing musical hues from separate sources.This routine has been followed for virtually all the 36 dates so far on the band’s tour: performance, grinding refinement, performance.Mr. Simon cautions that this fastidiousness is no rebuttal to his declaration that he’s ready to let it all go.“That doesn’t mean I don’t want my band to sound great,” he said.His new album, “Stranger to Stranger,” was released this spring into a shower of laudatory reviews.The performances by his touring group surge with moments of “delight and revelry,” as Mark Stewart, a guitarist (and cellist and player of the PVC pipe) described it.The album and a single, “Wristband,” have been among the top songs played on college radio.He has a detailed genesis for each tune, lyrically and musically.“I was having dinner with Paul Muldoon, the poet, and I said, I had this title I don’t know whether I want to keep it, ‘Wristband,’” Mr. Simon said.“He said, ‘It’s a good title.You could go a lot of places with that title, you should keep it.’” Sometime later, he got stuck while working on a lyric that involved a musician who steps into an alley behind a club and finds himself locked out, unable to regain entry without a wristband.He wasn’t sure what would happen in the song.“From out of nowhere, I said, wristband, it’s just a metaphor for, ‘You can’t get in.You don’t have what’s required,’” Mr. Simon said.“And that’s what’s going on.That battle is being fought right now, the haves and have-nots.“ His successes in popular music cover six decades, giving him rare late-inning creative triumph.In 1957, when he was 15, he and Mr. Garfunkel, playing as Tom and Jerry, had a minor hit with “Hey, Schoolgirl.” In 2016, “Stranger to Stranger” reached No.1 on Billboard’s lists for both best-selling rock and AmericanaFolk albums.It could put him in the running yet again for a Grammy among musicians 40 years his junior.(He has already won three Grammys for Album of the Year.)He labors at music and lyrics, he said, unwilling to accept what would have been satisfactory to him a few years earlier, feeling stalled.Then the songs will move ahead in leaps.“I was 21, maybe 22, when I wrote ‘The Sound of Silence,’ which seems to me like quite a big jump from where I was before that,” he said.“And why or where, I have no idea.I thought the same thing when I wrote ‘bridge over Troubled Water’ —whoa, that song is better than what I’ve been doing.Different chords and something special about it.
