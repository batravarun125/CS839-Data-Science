<location>WASHINGTON</location> — The Supreme Court on Tuesday let stand appeals court decisions that had blocked abortion restrictions in <location>Mississippi</location> and <location>Wisconsin</location>.The orders, part of a final set from the court before the justices left for their summer break, underscored the sweeping nature of Monday’s abortion rights decision striking down similar restrictions in <location>Texas</location>.In the <location>Mississippi</location> case, Currier v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, No.14-997, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in <location>New Orleans</location>, had said the challenged law would have shut down the state’s only abortion clinic.Officials in <location>Mississippi</location> said women could obtain abortions in neighboring states.But Judge E. Grady Jolly, writing for the majority, said, “<location>Mississippi</location> may not shift its obligation to respect the established constitutional rights of its citizens to another state.” In the <location>Wisconsin</location> case, Schimel v. Planned Parenthood of </location>Wisconsin<location>, No.15-1200, Judge Richard A. Posner in <location>Chicago</location>, had written an opinion that anticipated the majority’s approach in Monday’s Supreme Court decision.He said courts must balance the supposed health benefits of abortion restrictions against the burdens they impose on access to abortion.Soon after the Supreme Court ruled on Monday, <location>Alabama’s</location> attorney general, Luther Strange, announced that he would drop an appeal from a trial court ruling that had blocked his own state’s law restricting abortions.“There is no good faith argument that <location>Alabama’s</location> law remains constitutional in light of the Supreme Court ruling,” Mr.Strange said in a statement.The Supreme Court on Tuesday also denied a request that it rehear a case on public unions that had ended in a 4-to-4 deadlock.The plaintiffs had asked the court to reconsider the case once it was back to full strength.The court’s orders in the abortion and union cases were just a few words long and gave no reasons.The court also did not explain why it had turned down appeals in cases on pharmacists who objected to dispensing some kinds of birth control and on compelled disclosures in connection with elections.
