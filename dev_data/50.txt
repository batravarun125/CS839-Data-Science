“No establishment party represents these areas,” Mr. Guilluy said.“That’s why you’ve got Trump, Brexit and the National Front,” he added, referring to Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Anti-establishment anger is increasingly evident among the working-class left in <location>France</location>, mirroring a phenomenon in <location>Britain</location> in which disaffected Labour Party voters abandoned their party’s traditional pro-European stance to register their displeasure with policies and political leaders they felt had left them behind.“They’ve been governing for years against their own program,” said Jean-Marc Sanglier, a printing worker who attended an anti-Hollande demonstration in <location>Paris</location> last week.He was doggedly participating in the season’s 10th straight march against a proposed overhaul of the country’s labor laws by Mr. Hollande’s increasingly market-oriented Socialists — a betrayal in the eyes of Mr. Sanglier and his thousands of fellow marchers.“Brexit is exactly the same as the National Front; it’s a vote based on the same sociology and demographics,” said Mr. Guilluy, whose work has earned him the anger of the French left and much attention in the news media partly because it stresses working-class cultural anxieties in the face of immigration.The themes that defined the referendum in <location>Britain</location> have also resonated in <location>France</location> because of the terrorist attacks of the past year and a half and the longstanding problems <location>France</location> has had assimilating Muslim immigrants.When Mr. Hollande reacted to the British vote in a televised address on Friday, the first priority he cited was “the security and defense of our Continent, to protect our frontiers.” Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president who is running again as a center-right Republican, called <location>France</location> a “Christian country, in its culture and its mores,” in a much remarked-on speech this month that called attention to the country’s “cultural, moral and even spiritual identity.” Emmanuelle Reungoat, a National Front specialist at the University of Montpellier, said the British vote “was centralized around finding migrants a risk.” “In <location>France</location>, this could serve the National Front,” she said.“It’s an adaptation to the agenda of the National Front.” The British vote was also seized on to varying degrees by other far-right parties around <location>Europe</location>.Geert Wilders of the Party for Freedom in the <location>Netherlands</location> joined Ms.Le Pen in quickly calling for a referendum on membership in the bloc, although the anti-immigrant Alternative for <location>Germany</location> stopped short of doing the same.That party has called for a “<location>Europe</location> of Nations” — a new emphasis on national sovereignty — while avoiding the question of an exit from the bloc.In <location>Austria</location>, the far-right Freedom Party suggested making a vote contingent on whether the European Union continued with its “migration madness,” as its leader put it.<location>Italy’s</location> Five Star Movement, the second most popular party there, called for a nonbinding referendum on leaving the euro currency.In <location>France</location>, the British vote has accentuated the split between the mainstream parties in <location>France</location>, none of whom are calling for an exit, and the National Front.“It’s almost as though I used a curse word,” Ms.Le Pen said acidly as she left after her fruitless pitch to Mr. Hollande for a referendum.Given the array of other issues facing <location>France</location>, including a near-stagnant economy and high unemployment, it remains to be seen how central an issue membership in the bloc might be in the presidential race.But the National Front appears intent on using the moment.“I am European by civilization, and I am French by nationality,” Ms. Maréchal-Le Pen said on Monday.“I wouldn’t defend this cold monster that saps European identity.”
