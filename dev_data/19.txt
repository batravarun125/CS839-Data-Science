Legislation pending in Congress would require the Department of Homeland Security to collect social media information from foreign visitors.The bills were spurred by the terrorist attack in <location>San Bernardino</location> of <location>California</location>, in December.The couple who carried out the assault had exchanged private messages online discussing their commitment to jihad and martyrdom, law enforcement officials said, but they did not post any public messages about their plans.Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of <location>Florida</location>, who has introduced one of the bills requiring social media information, called the customs and border Protection proposal “lame.” “Voluntary disclosure won’t keep anyone safe,” Mr. Buchanan said.“If we want to win on the digital battlefield, mandatory screening is required.” Mr. Buchanan’s bill would direct the Department of Homeland Security to review all public records, including Facebook and other forms of social media, before admitting foreign travelers.The department said that while it does not consistently examine social media accounts of applicants for visas or immigration, it has a list of nearly three dozen situations in which social media can be examined to screen applicants.Four pilot projects are underway in the department to examine the use of social media among applicants for immigration benefits.One of the projects, which began in December and runs through this month, screens the social media accounts of applicants for so-called fiancé visas, the program under which one of the <location>San Bernardino</location> attackers entered the <location>United States</location>.
