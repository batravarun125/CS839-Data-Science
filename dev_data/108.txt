The original Danish version of the fairy tale “The Little Mermaid” is hardly the stuff of <location>Hollywood</location>: It ends bitterly with the mermaid unable to bear life as a human.But once the tale was massaged by Walt Disney, who gets a pass despite the periodic French skepticism of imports from <location>America</location>, the animated version became a runaway hit in <location>France</location>.Now, a French synchronized swimmer is trying to translate another aspect of the American mermaid obsession: mermaiding schools.It turns out that preadolescent and adolescent girls on both sides of the <location>Atlantic</location> dream of being mermaids.Julia Sardella, who spent four years in <location>Las Vegas</location> performing in a show that combines water ballet and aerial gymnastics, teaches the girls, and some of their mothers, how to swim gracefully after pulling on colorful leggings that end in a monofin.The classes appeal to the French love of fashion, with students donning elegant tops and tails, and are a good workout.“It’s great for your abdominals,” said Ms. Sardella, who also practices Pilates.
