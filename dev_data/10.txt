I wanted them to understand that there was a system and that they would have to be patient.What I was doing was self-soothing as a child — just telling myself, “The world works this way, don’t worry about it, you’re going to get everything you need.” Notions of wonder and the inner life of smaller things is integral to what I do — not just to my work but to how I live.Within something really small can be something that is complete and that doesn’t need to be sized up in any way.I love little beating hearts.I love that they beat just as strongly as big ones.I am fascinated by things that could be crushed but continue to keep on going because I feel like that as well.As a standup comedian, when I go onstage I’m very honest about the fact that my feelings are easily hurt, that I care about being looked at, and that I’m putting it on the line.I keep my field of vision small during the day and I try to be kind.Obviously, I mess up all the time.Like a lot of comedians and performers, I can be anxious and lonely, and I’m usually a chatterbox in an effort to hide the fact that I feel shy.But I am calm at the end of the night when I go to bed and know that I’ve kept it small.There’s a whole thing about ladies who have too many cats, and I understand that, but we don’t examine the women and men who have houses filled with figurines.That to me is much more of a concern and I don’t want to be that!But I do like creating tableaus all over my house with plants or little animals.I like the idea that even though my house is mine, there are little things living peacefully all over it.They are not aware of me, not just because they are inanimate, but because they’re their own thing.It’s the weirdest thing to feel so strongly that you love a small wooden rabbit but it doesn’t respond to you at all.It can’t validate my feelings — I just feel the way I feel and it’s exciting to trust in that process.This interview has been edited and condensed.
