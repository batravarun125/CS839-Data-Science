The financial instruments are bets on the creditworthiness of a company or country that borrows money.Right now, investors are particularly interested in credit default swaps tied to the creditworthiness of European banks.Let’s look at the swaps on UniCredit, a large Italian bank.An investor on one side of the credit default swap makes a payment to an investor on the other side of the swap.The investor making the payment stands to receive a big payout if UniCredit defaults.That probably won’t happen, of course.But if the cost of that insurance against default rises because of fears stirred up by an event like the Brexit crisis, the investor who bought the insurance against default before the crisis, when it was cheaper, can now sell the swap for a profit.And what is this swaps market telling us now about the banks?The good news: The costs of insuring against defaults by large banks is still far lower than it was during the financial crisis and when European debt markets were plunging.The not-so-good news: The cost of the swaps has jumped since the day before the Brexit vote, by as much 30 percent in the case of many European banks, according to data from Markit.Public data on credit default swap prices for individual banks is patchy to nonexistent, but Standard & Poor’s provides a useful index for swaps on large European banks here.Remember, though, unlike with a stock index, higher is not better.Parse central bank actions When markets panic, banks may find it hard to borrow money in the markets, one of the main ways they finance their operations.In such cases, central banks make emergency loans until the markets work again.The Bank of <location>England</location> has said it can make 250 billion pounds available.But if the Brexit crisis pushes  banks to use such loans, it may be hard to track how much they are borrowing.One of the ways in which banks were helped last year during the country’s debt crisis was through a loan facility called the emergency liquidity assistance.But the European Central Bank, and some national central banks, typically do not break out exactly how much each country is borrowing under that loan program, which added to the confusion last year.Why do these loans matter in assessing what the  crisis tells us about too-big-to-fail?These emergency loans can be like bailouts, because they rescue banks that were allowed to be overly reliant on short-term borrowing.Defenders of the practice say it is fine for a central bank to lend in times of trouble, as long as it charges a sufficiently high interest rate and lends only to solvent institutions.In that case, the loans would not be bailouts.If the central banks of <location>Europe</location> lend to banks in the coming days, it will be important to know how strict or how generous the loan terms are, to assess what’s really happening.So far, those who contend that the post-recession banking overhaul has significantly strengthened the system are winning the debate.Further evidence for their position: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said that all but one of the United States’ largest banks had unconditionally passed annual stress tests, and were thus allowed to distribute money to their shareholders.But it’s too early to see if the overhaul has succeeded.The real test would be whether a major European country that uses the euro — <location>Britain</location> does not — voted to follow <location>Britain</location> out of the European Union.It’s a frightening prospect, but it might take that to really test whether the too-big-to-fail banks can fail.
