<location>WASHINGTON</location> — C. C. Sabathia pitched with a bone spur for four years until it was surgically removed in 2012.His Yankees rotation mate Masahiro Tanaka had a bone spur that dated to his pitching career in <location>Japan</location>; it was extracted with arthroscopic surgery before this season.In baseball, bone spurs are a prevalent consequence of the sheer force of repeated throwing.“Just because somebody has a spur doesn’t mean that it’s something that needs to be taken out,” said Keith Meister, an orthopedic surgeon who serves as the <location>Texas</location> doctor.“You don’t touch any of this stuff, for the most part, until it becomes a problem.” Now the Mets are dealing with two high-profile cases of bone spurs.The Mets’ best starter this season, Noah Syndergaard, has a minor bone spur in the back of his right elbow, which has caused recent minor discomfort, Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson said before Tuesday’s game.Steven Matz has a larger bone spur in his left elbow, which is causing more discomfort, Alderson said.But Matz and Syndergaard will try to pitch through the pain with the help of anti-inflammatory medication, while Matz attempts to avoids what could be season-ending surgery.“I don’t think anxiety is the proper response in Syndergaard’s case,” Alderson said.“And in the case of Steven Matz, it’s pretty clear-cut as well.He’ll either be able to pitch and tolerate the discomfort or he won’t.The good thing is we know there’s no structural damage, and there’s nothing he can do to cause additional damage.” A bone spur is a growth of bone in the back of the elbow because of the friction between the ulna (forearm bone) and the humerus (the upper arm bone) during throwing, said Wiemi Douoguih, an orthopedic surgeon and former <location>Washington</location> team physician who is the director of sports medicine for MedStar Hospital Center.And when bone is pressured or damaged, it reforms.Traction between tendons or ligaments where they are attached to the bone can cause this, Meister said.Bone spurs can also be formed because the back side of the elbow and cartilage are constantly compressed when the arm is extended during throwing.If a bone spur becomes too large or is in a bad spot, it can cause pain during throwing.Imagine a doorstop wedged in a door hinge.“Some people pitch through the pain, as long as your mechanics aren’t disturbed and the pain is minor and you can get through it,” Douoguih said.“In some cases, that’ll be fine with treatment.But in other cases, it’ll get to the point that you can’t throw, and you clean it out.” In rarer cases, Meister said, bone spurs can be caused by the loosening of the ulnar collateral ligament, which can lead to more compression in the back of the elbow during throwing.And sometimes, spurs can break off and become loose bodies floating around the elbow.If surgery is warranted, the procedure is minor.
