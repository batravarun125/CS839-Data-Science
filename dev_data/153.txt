The <location>United States</location> anti-doping agency has filed a court action in <location>Houston</location> seeking to compel a deposition from an endocrinologist being investigated for possibly providing banned substances to track and field athletes.The activities of the endocrinologist, Jeffrey S. Brown, are being examined as part of a continuing investigation by Usada of the prominent Nike Project coach Alberto Salazar, a person familiar with the investigation said Tuesday, on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.“While we don’t comment on the specifics of any investigation, as always Usada’s actions are solely focused on the pursuit of the truth and doing what is best to protect the rights of clean athletes and the integrity of competition,” Ryan Madden, a spokesman, said in a statement.Dr. Brown could not be reached Tuesday evening.In an email, Mr. Salazar denied any wrongdoing.“I believe in a clean sport and a methodical, dedicated approach to training,” Mr. Salazar wrote.“The Project will never permit doping.” Mr. Salazar said that he had not heard from the antidoping agency despite voluntarily meeting with officials more than six months ago.“I look forward to this unfair and protracted process reaching the conclusion I know to be true,” he wrote.The court filing by Usada was made on June 23, a week before the <location>United States</location> Olympic track and field trials in <location>Eugene</location>, <location>Oregon<location>.The event will determine which athletes compete for the <location>United States</location> at the <location>Rio</location> games in August.The filing, made in district court in <location>Harris County</location>, <location>Tex.</location>, said Usada had information that individuals – presumed to be athletes — had traveled long distances to be treated by Dr. Brown in an attempt to enhance athletic performance, which “raises questions about whether some of these treatments may have violated sport anti-doping rules.” Court documents indicated that a hearing would be held on July 11.Usada has received consent from many individuals, including patients of Dr. Brown’s, to interview him about his treatment of them “concerning whether his treatments have been in compliance with sport anti-doping rules,” the filing said.Despite written permission from athletes for Dr. Brown to discuss his treatment of them, the filing said, he has declined.Usada said it believed it had exhausted “all reasonable efforts to obtain voluntary compliance from Dr. Brown,” and is now seeking legal redress to force him to give a videotaped deposition.Dr. Brown is known in the track world for a distinctive practice of diagnosing hypothyroidism in distance runners – and at least one famous sprinter, the former Olympic champion Carl Lewis.The condition is an underactive thyroid that can lead to weight gain and fatigue but is considered relatively rare among athletes.
