Willis, who teaches tennis lessons at boat club, may be the only active coach in the main singles draws, but Amra Sadikovic was a tennis coach not long ago.Two years ago, she retired because it was no longer fun to toil in the lower levels of pro tennis.She found a job at a tennis club in <location>Basel<location>.Sadikovic spent more than a year away, but was inspired to come back by another Swiss player, 11th-ranked Timea Bacsinszky, who has been successful since returning to the tour after a hiatus.On Tuesday, Sadikovic’s comeback reached Centre Court, where she played Serena Williams, the defending champion.Sadikovic, 27, had never played a main draw match at Wimbledon, or any other Grand Slam tournament, and her ranking of 148th is a career high.But she won the first two points of the match and even had two break-point opportunities in the first game before Williams settled into a groove on her way to a 6-2, 6-4 victory.It was Williams’s first match since losing the final at the French Open earlier this month.“It was a good start for me,” said the top-seeded Williams, who has not won a Grand Slam title since last year.“I felt like it was a solid start to go in the right direction.” Williams said she was well prepared for Sadikovic’s “old-school grass-court game.” “I felt I was where I needed to be,” Williams added.“I needed to be pumped for the match.I needed to be intense.I needed to show a lot and feel a lot on the court.” Sadikovic listed Williams among the players she admired most and said it was an honor to play her.In the final points of the match, both players were smiling as each hit backhand winners that clipped the baseline.Sadikovic was used to watching Williams on television.But Broady said such a viewpoint can make the top players seem superhuman.After 1 hour 43 minutes of being 80 feet away from Murray on Centre Court, Broady said that he felt as if he belonged, and that Murray seemed like just another guy.“I don’t feel like I was completely outplayed today,” Broady said.“I don’t feel like I was completely overawed.I felt like I was a man playing against another man.” Among the men’s matches completed before play was suspended on the outside courts, No.4 Stan Wawrinka ousted the American teenager Taylor Fritz, 7-6 (4), 6-1, 6-7 (2), 6-4; No.7 Richard Gasquet topped Bedene, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3; and No.15 Nick Kyrgios outlasted Radek Stepanek, 6-4, 6-3, 6-7 (9), 6-1.In the women’s draw, No.6 Roberta Vinci defeated Alison Riske of the <location>United States</location>, 6-2, 5-7, 6-3; and No.13 Svetlana Kuznetsova beat Caroline Wozniacki, 7-5, 6-4.Wozniacki returned this month after being out since March with injuries.Ranked 45th, she was unseeded at a Grand Slam event for the first time since the 2008 Australian Open.
