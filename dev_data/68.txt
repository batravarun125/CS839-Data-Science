I carried a large portfolio which I set down against a wall.“It’s Ramadan,” Ali said.“I’m tired.And hungry.” I explained why I was there.“Show me.” I pulled out portraits, all of them in black and white, printed by means of a 19th-century method where the photographs are often mistaken for charcoal drawings.“Those are great drawings.” I explained they were in fact photographs.We worked steadily for three days, mornings only, in a film studio I had rented.Ali always arrived on time, accompanied by friends, handlers and helpers.He was a real trouper and lent himself to all the demands, tricks and manipulations that a photographer pulls out of his bag.You had to be fast, however, because his attention span was very short — a matter of a minute, after which he got bored and restless.The only instance Ali interfered was when the NBC television crew from <location>New York</location> arrived to record the sitting, and the producer tried to impose her directives.Ali warned her, “It’s John’s shoot.If you don’t behave yourself, you and your crew are out!” The following day, we had lunch together.Not at home, but in a restaurant.When a couple of weeks later I returned to <location>Chicago</location> with the prints, he inscribed the one I liked best, of his arm extended and his beautiful fist with its well-shaped nails: “To John Stewart, Muhammad Ali, May 13-77 Love Always.”
