It took just 16 minutes.Emergency calls from inside the pulse nightclub poured into the <location>Orlando</location> police in the early morning of June 12 from panicked and wounded revelers reporting the bloody scene as it played out.Dispatchers noted that they, too, could hear gunshots in the background, according to a police log that was among hundreds of pages of documents about the massacre released by the city on Tuesday.The incident log gives a staccato narration, based on entries made in real time and time-stamped down to the minute and the second — the most detailed account yet of what happened after Omar Mateen, 29, armed with an assault rifle and a handgun, walked into a bustling club with a mostly gay and Latino clientele and opened fire.It shows the confusion as police officials tried to figure out what was happening, the horror of some victims reporting on their own gunshot wounds, and the abject fear of dozens of people trapped in pockets throughout the club, whispering into their phones, pleading for rescue, and hoping that the gunman would not come for them next.Other documents released on Tuesday raised questions about whether one of pulse’s exits might have been blocked.At the end of a three-hour standoff, for which some have criticized the police’s delayed response, 49 people had been killed and 53 wounded.But nearly all the slaughter took place in just those first 16 minutes.The first report of shots fired came just before 2:03 a.m., and that awful message was repeated no fewer than 30 times, as caller after caller described the massacre, sometimes in English, sometimes in Spanish, and sometimes just by picking up the horror in the background on their cellphones.Often, the entries say simply, “Still shooting,” or that people could be heard screaming.At one point, a dispatcher noted having “open line hearing 20-30 gunshots.” The gunfire paused for 30 seconds or so, until at 2:08 a.m., the first police officers on the scene attempted to enter the building and engaged in a shootout with Mr. Mateen, who then retreated to a bathroom where people were hiding.Just before 2:19 a.m., about the time the city’s SWAT team was called out, the shooting stopped as suddenly as it had begun, and the killer hunkered down for almost three hours with his hostages.But while the barrage was still underway, evidence of the grim toll began rolling in, noted by dispatchers in entries sprinkled with abbreviations Fire Department officials said Tuesday that the photo was taken on the day of the shooting, but that no exits had been blocked.A lawyer for the club, Gus R. Benitez, also insisted that all public exits had been clear.Ms. Hughes and Mr. Williams also traded emails on the day of the shooting about a May 27 inspection showing that “an exit was blocked.” But on Tuesday, officials refuted information contained in city records and said that there had been no blocked exit doors and that the only infractions were minor, nothing more serious than a nonworking light bulb in an exit sign.
