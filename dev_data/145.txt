<location>OMAHA</location> — For the best swimmers in the <location>United States</location>, the road to <location>Rio de Janeiro</location> goes through CenturyLink Center.But where it goes from there is difficult to map.In 2012, Missy Franklin came to the Olympic trials and treated every final she made as a reason to dance, and she gamboled her way to berths in the London Games in four individual events and three relays.Franklin, 21, is a self-described “people pleaser,” but in the aftermath of her five-Olympic-medal performance in <location>London</location>, she faced the impossible task of trying to satisfy the competing interests vying for her time and attention.She followed her heart, maintaining her amateur status long enough to finish high school and swim two years at the University of <location>California</location>.And last year she followed her head and turned pro to cash in on her high profile.At these trials, Franklin is everywhere.Her likeness is plastered on the doors to the arena entrance.A promotional ad for Minute Maid, one of her sponsors, in which she tearfully thanks her parents for their support in a poignant letter she reads aloud, played on Tuesday before the start of the preliminaries on the giant video and timing board that hangs over the competition pool.Franklin is everywhere but on the 2016 <location>United States</location> Olympic team, so far.In the final of the 100-meter backstroke — one of the two individual events in which she hoped to defend her 2012 title in the Rio Games — she finished seventh in the final, beating only Natalie Coughlin, 33, a 12-time Olympic medalist who is attempting to make her fourth Summer Games.Olivia Smoliga, 21, placed first with a time of 59.02 seconds.Kathleen Baker, 19, was second, with 59.29.Franklin, who posted a 58.85 to win the event at the 2012 trials, swam the backstroke less than 25 minutes after she advanced to the final of the 200 freestyle with a time of 1 minute 0.24 of a second, the fourth-fastest time in the semifinals.Ryan Lochte, 31, an 11-time Olympic medalist who on Sunday missed making the team in one of his gold-medal events, the 400-meter individual medley, finished fourth Tuesday in the 200 freestyle, won by Townley Haas, 19, to qualify for the team in a relay.Franklin’s best event is the 200-meter backstroke, which will be contested Friday, with the finals taking place Saturday.She owns the two fastest times in history and is the top-ranked American in this year’s world rankings, at No.6.Franklin is also entered in the 100 freestyle, which begins Thursday.She finished fifth in that event in <location>London</location> .But her competition, if she chooses to swim it, will be formidable.
