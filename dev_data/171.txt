<location>DETROIT</location> — For the public faces of Volkswagen in the <location>United States</location> — the dealers — the company’s sweeping settlement actually settles very little.The documents filed in federal court on Tuesday explain in great detail how Volkswagen plans to financially compensate the owners of the diesel cars it equipped with emissions-cheating software, many of which it will end up buying back.The deal is meant to pay owners the full market value of their cars before Volkswagen publicly admitted its cheating in September and to give them up to $10,000 in compensatory money on top of that.But for the 600 Volkswagen dealerships around the country, stuck for months with tainted new and used Passats and Jettas on their lots that few people wanted, the company plans in some cases to pay compensation of only a fraction of their prescandal value — about 40 percent, according to dealers the company briefed on Tuesday.After that, the dealers can choose to fix and try to sell them.But they have not been told whether they will also have the option of having Volkswagen buy them back.And the dealers’ service departments will be obliged to fix any of the fume-spewing cars brought in by owners, rather than sell them back to Volkswagen.Trouble is, the precise nature of the fix has still not been determined by Volkswagen or approved by the Environmental Protection Agency.And none of this will necessarily reduce the damage to the Volkswagen brand in coming model years.“I think Volkswagen will take care of the customer, but dealers are in this, too,” Rick Mastria, the owner of a Volkswagen dealership in <location>Raynham</location>, said on Tuesday.He had the bad luck of buying the dealership last year only weeks before Volkswagen admitted the lie behind its “clean diesel’’ technology.And because of the scandal, the government has not allowed any 2016 Volkswagen diesels to be sold in the <location>United States.</location>  “You get numb after a while,’’ Mr. Mastria said.“We just try to stay upbeat and sell used cars.” Volkswagen briefed a small group of dealers on the settlement on Monday.A company spokeswoman, Jeannine Ginivan, on Tuesday declined to comment on Volkswagen’s confidential discussions with its dealers.Volkswagen brand sales have slumped since the cheating was disclosed.In the first five months of this year, its sales in the <location>United States</location> totaled 125,205 cars and sport utility vehicles, a 13 percent drop from the comparable period in 2015.
