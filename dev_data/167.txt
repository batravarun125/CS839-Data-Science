 URLike so many others who beat the odds to make it to <location>Broadway</location>, they arrived with personal stories to tell.Muhammad Yunus, 18, who was born in <location>Indonesia</location>, was a rapper with no connection to musical theater until six months ago, when he played the lead in a student production of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “In the Heights.” Marnie Quick, 17, didn’t think she’d get to the big stage because she was still recovering from a concussion and a dislocated pubic bone at the time of auditions.Deimoni Brewington, 17, is taunted at <location>Las Vegas</location> high school and even by some relatives for choosing musical theater over macho pursuits like football.“Yeah, I cried a lot,” he said of the teasing.“But when I go into rehearsal, I put away all the mess and drama of my life and have fun.Musical theater gave me my identity.” These three teenagers and 59 others from around the country performed onstage at the theater on Monday night at the National High School Musical Theater Awards, now in their eighth year.The evening was part prize ceremony, part bake-off, with eight finalists performing one song each.At the end, two graduating seniors walked off with the top honors: Amina Faye, from the Central Academy of Technology and Arts in <location>Monroe</location> and Josh Strobl, from John Burroughs High School in <location>Burbank</location>.Accepting her award, Ms. Faye told the other performers, “I love you all and I can’t wait to see where the future takes us all.” The ceremony capped a 10-day theatrical boot camp for the students, with early wake-up calls and all-day coaching from six Broadway performers.The teenagers stayed in university dorm rooms, did yoga, ate together in a common area and received both individual and group instruction from the coaches and Kiesha Lalama, a choreographer with the <location>Pittsburgh</location> CLO theater organization, which is a founder of the awards.The winners received $10,000 toward their college educations and a chance to audition for acceptance and a scholarship to the Tisch School of the Arts at N.Y.U.Finalists and other award winners got $2,500 scholarship grants.To make the cut, each student first won a competition as the best male or female high school performer in one of 31 regions.More than 1,000 schools and 50,000 students competed for honors.The prizes are known as the Jimmy Awards, in honor of the <location>Broadway</location> producer and theater owner James M. Nederlander, 94.For four students, the trip was their first time in an airplane.But for Ms. Quick, who began taking music classes at 10 weeks, the show was familiar; it was her third time performing at the awards and her second time as a finalist, singing “Safer” from “First Date” in this year’s competition.“It’s pretty crazy,” she said of the past year, which was upended when she smashed her cheek and hip on a concrete floor while acting in a student film.
