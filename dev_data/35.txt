Bill loved to laugh, loved night life, loved the group of creative people through whom I first met him many decades ago.For those people — the illustrator Antonio Lopez, a show of whose work is on view at a hotel; and the assorted madcap beings they attracted like the Warhol superstar Donna Jordan, the model Pat Cummins or any of the characters that populated the multiethnic fun house that was 1970s <location>New York</location> — Bill was a boon companion, always up to follow the party wherever it went.One thought again of that Bill at the Kenzo show last Saturday morning, a fantasy of a <location>New York</location> night life largely improvised by gay people over the decades and now effectively kaput.“Night life is the soul of any city,” Carol Lim and Humberto, the impresarios behind Opening Ceremony and the Kenzo designers, said in their press notes.“The collection pays homage to the club lore that narrates our past and paves the way for tomorrow.Long live the venues and parties that will create and incubate the legends to come.” Whether a label that was acquired by LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton can generate anything resembling the euphoric experience of a night at Flamingo, Paradise Garage, the Tenth Floor, the Sound Factory, Twilo, Boy Bar, the Pyramid Club, Click & Drag, Jackie 60 and other clubs with names too raunchy to record here remains to be seen.Yet Bill would have been — I certainly was — persuaded by the sincerity of the effort: the dance trousers, the blue-and-lime tracksuits, the slightly cheesy ribbed knits, the trousers slung low enough to reveal printed boxers hiked bellybutton high, zip up boots, the Pop-printed hoodies emblazoned “Brilliant,” the shorts cut to embarrassing gym-class lengths.(The performance artist John Sex rocked that look for a minute; Madonna soon “adapted” it from him.)And the old-school house music, brilliantly remixed by Todd Terry, helped.Even on a bright and sunny Saturday morning at an hour when club kids are still staggering home, tunes like the Jungle Brothers’ “I’ll House You” had guests like Chloë Sevigny and the dancer-choreographer Justin Peck bobbing their heads as if the party were just getting started.Held in the long, waning light of a northern summer evening, the music for Riccardo Tisci’s fine Givenchy show had a similar drum-and-bass vibe reminiscent of late nights at the disco.And you could almost read into his decision to add dresses to a men’s wear show parallels to a specific club demographic: of the 65 looks, 13 (roughly 20 percent) were clothes from the women’s haute couture.That is about the same proportion of women to men you might find on the floor of a typical gay dance club.Mr. Tisci called his men “happy warriors,” and said the show was about power and money, as what is not anymore?Power here took the obvious form of military references on nylon sportswear with zippered panels at the hips and canted at kidney level; money was signified mostly through computer-generated graphic camouflage pattered from dollar bills.The slicked-down hair on the models brought to mind the street toughs of Mr. Tisci’s southern Italian background, as did a casting that skewed in a traditionally masculine direction and well away from the northern climes and the representative pale ephebes favored now by many designers.Mirror discs on the clothes glinted from hems and peplums.Though these were allegedly references to couture techniques, they had more of the D.I.Y.look of the sparkly stuff favored by a druggie glow-stick crowd.It was the essence of a Bill Cunningham photo essay, one of those image surveys that, though they sometimes seemed serendipitous and offhand, had been harvested as assiduously as any field study conducted by trained anthropologists.Bill operated that way.His memory for fashion was the mainframe; algorithms organized themselves organically in his head.He had seen the Yohji Yamamoto show before, many times over.Too modest to make much of his knowledge base, he would have found something wholesomely cheering to say about a collection of squared-off jackets, wide and high trousers, tunics and pugilist head wraps.It was a grouping that found its best expression in a phrase scrawled ungrammatically on the back of a jacket: “Yohjis for hire.”
