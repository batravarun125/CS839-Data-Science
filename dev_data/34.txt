Mr. Mehrotra said the shrikhand is a nod in <location>Gujarat</location>, in <location>India</location>, and so is the puréed mango part of the dessert: A popular treat there is aamras, a simple treat of pure mango pulp served with dunking bread.“Usually these are two different things from the same region,” Mr. Mehrotra said in a phone call from <location>Kerala</location>, in southern <location>India</location>.“I have combined them to make one dessert.” But by tossing in the chewy cubes, he is also winking at a third sweet that’s familiar to children in <location>India</location>: aam papad, a candylike fruit leather made by drying sheets of mango in the sunshine.For customers with roots in <location>India</location>, the complete dish is meant to act as a gentle array of nostalgic reminders.“These things are very much part of our tradition,” Mr. Mehrotra said.“Everyone misses their childhood.” And for anyone who tries it, the dessert is intended to serve as a light, simple, fruit-and-candy counterpoint to the complexity of modern dining — and life.“I think we are becoming too modern, and we are forgetting these things,” the chef went on.“I really want to revive all these things.”
