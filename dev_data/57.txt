Meister said a simple bone spur operation involved drilling two small holes in the back of the elbow and could take up to 15 minutes.Some pitchers can return to throwing within six weeks, but Meister often warns patients that it may take about 12 weeks before they return to pitching in games.For now, the Mets and Matz want to avoid surgery.The foundation of the team is starting pitching, and its depth would be strained without Matz if he had surgery, which Alderson estimated would keep the pitcher out until Oct. 1.Mets officials said Matz, who had Tommy John surgery in 2010, would continue taking anti-inflammatory medication.They will push back his originally scheduled start to Thursday and use Logan Verrett for a spot start on Wednesday instead.“As long as they feel comfortable with me being out there with the way I’m pitching, then I’d think I’m going to battle through it,” Matz said.“That’s the mind-set: Just get it all behind me and go out there and pitch.” The issue is if Matz’s pitching will be affected because he can’t throw normally, and if he needs regular extra rest.Alderson said the Mets would consider a six-man rotation later in the season.Matz said the bone spur was spotted in his magnetic resonance imaging exam in early May.Mets Manager Terry Collins said Matz felt the most discomfort during his rough start against the Braves on Friday, in which he could not finish his pitches.Matz pitched well in May but has struggled in June.He said adrenaline took over during games so he could not tell when the discomfort was worse.Collins said he, the pitching coach Dan Warthen and others would watch Matz carefully to see if his mechanics changed, which could lead to other problems.“If I’m claiming to be able to pitch, then I have no excuses,” Matz said.“I expect myself to go out and pitch like I can.” Matz’s bone spur will need to be removed at some point, perhaps after the season, Alderson said.“I’ll cross that bridge when we get there,” Matz said.Alderson said doctors assured him that neither pitcher, whose elbows are considered structurally sound, will be compromised by pitching with the spurs.While Matz will be monitored from start to start, Alderson said he did not expect the same issues with Syndergaard.Collins said Syndergaard’s rough pitching in Monday’s loss to the Nationals was because of overthrowing to prove he was healthy and not because of the spur.Syndergaard, who denied Monday he had a spur, has said his elbow feels strong.“It’s a very small spur that may exist with 90 percent of the pitchers throwing in major league baseball today,” Alderson said.“It’s not significant.”
