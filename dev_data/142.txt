In <location>New York</location> on Tuesday night, incumbents in the state’s congressional primaries appeared to be on track to keep their seats, while the aftereffects of the presidential primary season rippled through other contests, setting up unpredictable clashes over the balance of power in the House of Representatives in the fall.Breezing past their challengers: Representative Gregory W. Meeks, which covers a large chunk of <location>Queens</location> and parts of <location>Nassau</location> county; Representative Nydia M. Velázquez, of the Seventh, which includes parts of northern <location>Brooklyn</location> and <location>Queens</location> ; Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, of the 10th, which runs down the <location>Manhattan</location> and into southern <location>Brooklyn</location>; Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, of the 12th, which straddles the <location>East River</location> to cover eastern <location>Manhattan</location>, waterfront <location>Queens</location> and northern <location>Brooklyn</location>; and Representative José E. Serrano, of the 15th, in <location>Bronx</location>.All five, who are Democrats, will have an even easier time of it in the general election, given that their districts are deep blue.But in other cases, Tuesday’s matchups were but a prelude to November’s, in which every seat not safely in partisan territory will be buffeted by the uncertain effects of having Donald J. Trump at the top of the Republican ticket.Democrats are hoping that an aversion to Mr. Trump will help them pick up more seats in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives than they otherwise would in the fall, though the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is popular in parts of upstate <location>New York</location> and <location>Long Island</location>.The ramifications of Trump’s candidacy will be tested in districts on <location>Long Island</location>, where the Republican incumbent, Lee Zeldin, is a stout Trump supporter.Two Democrats — Anna Throne-Holst, a former <location>Southampton</location> town supervisor, and Dave Calone, a venture capitalist and a former federal prosecutor — were battling for the chance to challenge him, with Ms. Throne-Holst holding on to a very slim lead around 11 p.m. on Tuesday.One high-profile contest centered on the 19th District, in the <location>Hudson Valley</location> where Zephyr Teachout, a law professor who made her political name with an unexpectedly rugged challenge to Gov.Andrew M. Cuomo in the 2014 primary, blew past Will Yandik, an environmentalist and farmer, in the Democratic primary.Ms. Teachout, who was backed by Senator Bernie Sanders, is running to replace Representative Chris Gibson, a Republican who had considered running for governor in 2018 but decided instead to retire from politics.The Republican results in the 19th on Tuesday night began as more of a muddle, in large part because of an unexplained error on the ballots sent to more than 50 Columbia County polling sites.Only two candidates were running — John Faso, a former state assemblyman who also made an unsuccessful bid for the governor’s office, and Andrew Heaney, a businessman.
