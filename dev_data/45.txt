“I think we should make sure that our trading relationship is stable, so that our respective economies are not affected but actually improved.” When the House returns from its recess next week, Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of <location>Pennsylvania</location>, will introduce a resolution to call on the Obama administration to immediately begin the process of initiating discussions for just such a deal.“The ‘Brexit’ referendum, for better or for worse, is behind us,” Mr. Dent said in a statement.“This was a decision for the British people to make, and they chose to leave.We must respect that decision whether we agree with it or not.Now Congress has a responsibility and interest to work with the <location>United Kingdom</location>, particularly when it comes to strengthening economic ties between our two great nations.” Congressional Republicans have largely been careful not to weigh in on whether the referendum results were good policy, but to vocally emphasize the importance of <location>Britain</location> as an American ally.The trade notions, which will most likely gain steam next week, are a way of reiterating that point while also getting back to trade talk in a relatively noncontroversial way.
