Among all the anxieties that Britain’s decision to leave the European Union has provoked, here’s another one: Are big banks going to be in trouble?Taxpayers in <location>Europe</location> and the <location>United State</location> might want to know.The Brexit vote could very well be a test of whether governments have, since the financial crisis of 2008, limited the threat that large banks pose to the wider economy.In 2008, governments around the world decided to spend huge sums bailing out their nations’ banks, underscoring that they were “too big to fail.” Brexit will go a long way toward telling us whether they still are.Today, banks are stronger.They have more capital, meaning they borrow less money to finance their loans and trading.Lower borrowing makes them more stable.The banks also have higher reserves of liquid cash they can tap into if it becomes hard to borrow money in the markets.So, how are they doing?Here are some ways to assess the stress in the financial system.Watch the bank stock prices The Brexit crisis has pushed bank shares down a lot, particularly in <location>Europe</location>.Shares in Barclays, a large British lender that has a big presence on Wall Street, are down 24 percent since the day before the Brexit vote on June 23.Deutsche Bank, <location>Germany’s</location> largest lender, is off nearly 16 percent since then.The valuations on bank stocks also look awful, particularly a yardstick called the price-to-book ratio.This effectively compares a bank’s market value with its net worth as stated in its balance sheet.If that ratio is below one, it suggests investors are skeptical about the bank.Deutsche Bank is trading at around 30 percent of its net worth, a big discount.In the <location>United States</location>, Bank of <location>America</location> is trading at just under 60 percent of its book value, a ratio even lower than in 2009, when losses from the financial crisis were still piling up.But it can be a mistake to think that a bank is in dire trouble because its stock is slumping or its valuation looks sickly.The declines might reflect investors’ belief that it will be harder for the banks to make profits in the future, particularly if Brexit leads to a recession.Or it may be a signal that the market believes the bank will have to break itself up, or sell operations, to become more streamlined.But this is something a bank can do without help from the taxpayer.There is, however, a situation in which a steep decline in a bank’s stock can matter: when it wants to issue new stock to shore up its balance sheet.The further a bank’s stock falls, the more it has to sell to raise the same amount of money, and that can lead to a downward spiral in the stock price that prevents the bank from selling any stock.In such circumstances, the government may step in and provide the new funds in a bailout.This may be a reason Italy’s government is reportedly considering a rescue for its banks.If that happens, it would indicate that “too big to fail” is still a problem in <location>Europe’s</location> fourth-largest economy.Credit default swaps Credit default swaps were a big deal in the financial crisis.
