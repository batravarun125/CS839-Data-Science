In his most expansive speech to date, Donald J. Trump laid out a case on Tuesday for tearing up trade pacts and confronting <location>China</location> as he stood at a recycling plant near <location>Pittsburgh.</location>  Mr. Trump’s speech was perhaps the most forceful case he has made for the crux of his candidacy: not just that he is a businessman with a well-established personal brand, but that the days of globalism have passed, and that a new approach is necessary.He did not suggest change in tiny increments.Instead, he forcefully challenged the decades-old shibboleths of Republican economic orthodoxy as yoked closely to pro-business interests.Mr. Trump did not expressly describe his views as nationalist, but he did call for an era of economic “Americanism.” The speech was well delivered by a candidate who is still adjusting to the use of teleprompters.
