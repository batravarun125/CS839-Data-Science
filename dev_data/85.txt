And bless his heart, Juan was faced with that.” Now 27 years old in a period when hyper-fit players over 30 abound, del Potro still has time to make an impact and has already left a legacy, with the 18-year-old American Taylor Fritz citing him as a prime inspiration.But del Potro has much less time than he once did and, for now, one fewer major weapon.He used to be a flat-hitting force of nature off both wings.But he has had to adjust his two-handed backhand and slice many more backhands with one hand.“One of the things that he and I have talked about a lot was that there were some aspects of his swing that put a tremendous amount of pressure on his wrist,” Berger said.“And when he would prepare for a backhand, especially a topspin shot, he would dip his left upper extremity down and basically hyperextend his wrist to come up and actually make contact with the ball.And it was at that precise moment he had the pain, and for the longest time, it was a challenge, first of all, to figure out what was causing it.It took a couple of operations.” After another round of immobilization, rehabilitation and then a gradual return to competition, it ended up taking a third operation, as well.The consequence was there on the statistics sheet on Tuesday.Del Potro had 20 forehand winners and zero backhand winners.That is an imbalance that men like Wawrinka — sympathy or no sympathy — will continue to exploit.Del Potro believes he simply needs more big-pressure matches and thinks he might not be back on the full attack until next season.“I’m not having all my confidence on my backhands yet,” he said.“And that’s tough when you play against the top guys, because they are such good players and they are strong enough to play in the fifth-set matches.This is my comeback after three years.I’m expecting to be better in the future.” Berger urges the younger generation to take precautions in a sport that is increasingly stressful on so many joints.Nadal, who is missing with a wrist injury, is the latest example.“It’s so much more of a contact sport than people think it is,” Berger said.“The more we can do to cut down on the vibration is probably going to be helpful, but in reality, I think it’s so much about the demands of play with the extreme positions and the forces they are putting on the wrist.I don’t think equipment modifications or rule changes are going to do the trick, because obviously a lot of good tennis is being played with the equipment as it stands.“But I think as far as the athletes are concerned, we are beginning to understand the importance of reflexive and proprioceptive training,” he added.“That’s an attempt to bring the muscles that cross the joint into more of a role of stabilizing the joint, not just moving it.So we don’t depend just on the ligaments.” Berger recommends training with exercise balls that contain internal gyroscopes or with long, flexible, carbon-fiber blades that oscillate.Del Potro travels with such tools, but there is no doubt that it would have been better for him if he had known way back when what he knows now.Better for his sport, too.
