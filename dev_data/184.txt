Set in stone is supposed to mean immutable, but Luigi Del Bianco’s determined descendants just now appear to be winning the official affirmation that the Italian-American  deserved long ago for shaping one of the nation’s most famous monuments.“If being the chief carver at <location>Mount Rushmore</location> is not the American dream for an immigrant to these lands, what is?” said Douglas Gladstone, the author of the 2014 book, “Carving a Niche for Himself: The Untold Story of Luigi Del Bianco.” Hundreds of workers finished sculpting the faces of four American presidents (Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Lincoln) in <location>Rushmore’s</location> granite southeast slope in <location>South Dakota</location> 75 years ago.They toiled under the direction of Gutzon Borglum, the designer and chief engineer, and his son Lincoln, and their names are listed at the monument as part of a team effort.But last month, the National Park Service finally recognized the singular contribution that Gutzon Borglum had long ago attributed to Del Bianco, who came from <location>Naples</location>, <location>Italy</location>, when he was 17 and eventually settled in <location>Port Chester</location>, <location>N.Y.</location>  On Facebook, the National Park Service posted this biography, which officially mentioned Del Bianco’s title for the first time: “Artist Luigi Del Bianco came to work at <location>Mount Rushmore</location> at the request of Gutzon Borglum, the designer and engineer of the stone sculpture.Luigi Del Bianco worked for Mr. Borglum during the seasons of 1933, 1935, 1936 and 1940.He was a Senior Driller until the end of July in 1935 when Mr. Borglum designated him Chief Carver.” Cameron Sholly, the director of the region for the National Park Service, which includes South Dakota, said that when he assumed the position last year he began reassessing Del Bianco’s role at the request of the carver’s 53-year-old grandson Lou.Correspondence provided by Lou Del Bianco, who lives in <location>Port Chester</location>, and research by park service historians, convinced Mr. Sholly that for whatever reason, Luigi Del Bianco’s contribution had been overlooked.“He is worth any three men I could find in America, for this particular type of work,” Borglum wrote, in documents that Lou Del Bianco and an uncle, Caesar Del Bianco, discovered at the Library of Congress.“He is the only intelligent, efficient stone carver on the work who understands the language of the sculptor.” Del Bianco was born in 1892 aboard a ship near <location>France</location>, as his parents were returning to <location>Italy</location> from the <location>United States.</location> Raised in <location>Venice</location>, he studied stone carving in <location>Vienna</location> and <location>Venice</location> starting when he was 11.He immigrated to <location>Vermont</location> when a cousin wrote that skilled carvers were in demand there.He returned to fight for <location>Italy</location> in World War I, went back to <location>Vermont</location> in 1920 and finally settled in <location>Port Chester</location>, where a fellow carver introduced him to Borglum, who hired him to work at his studio in <location>North Stamford</location>, as well as to his future wife, Nicoletta Cardarelli.Del Bianco and Borglum worked together briefly on the Confederate Memorial on Stone Mountain in <location>Georgia</location>, and on the Wars of America Memorial in <location>Newark</location> (Del Bianco was a model for a number of the figures).In 1933, Del Bianco was recruited, eventually as chief carver at $1.50 an hour, or $72 a week.
