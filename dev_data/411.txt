“Now we steep them in broth almost like tea.” Her dish starts with a strain of corn called Bloody Butcher.She grinds it fresh and simmers the grits in three parts water to one part milk.An egg — preferably gathered from nearby fields during the late spring and summer, when the chickens have lots of bugs to eat and the yolks turn deep orange — gets a sous-vide bath and then goes into the bowl.Next comes a ladle or two of smoky chicken stock, punched up with a little lemon juice.She spoons on chicken-skin cracklings, chopped peanuts that have been candied in syrup and black pepper, and grits that she has frozen into a block and then shaved into a deep-fat fryer, Fritos style.A little sliced radish and some chives offer contrast.“It’s such a sneaker dish,” she said.“You get this bowl of brown stuff with an egg, and you’re like, ‘This looks terrible.’ But then you taste it, and you can’t believe how good it is.” I will never make fun of a farm egg again.
