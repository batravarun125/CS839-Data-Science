Times Insider shares insights into how we work at Times.In this article, Adam Liptak, at <location>Times’s Square</location> street, describes taking preparation to an extreme.The Supreme Court’s term starts in October, and for the nine months that follow it proceeds at a stately pace.But its end, in late June, always feels like an anxiety dream in which you have forgotten to turn in the college thesis that stands between you and graduation.The justices are to blame.For reasons that have long puzzled scholars, they routinely save their biggest decisions for the last days of the term, creating a news pileup that was demanding enough in the print era, and creates fresh and scary challenges given the insistent needs of the digital age.The key, then and now, is preparation.I mean this in two senses.First of all, reporters who cover the court spend the entire term preparing for its end by reading briefs, attending arguments, consulting law professors, going to conferences and interviewing lawyers and litigants.We know the cases intimately, understand the dynamics among the justices and have a good sense of the likely outcomes and consequences.These days I also prepare in a more pedestrian way: writing up advance versions of articles that can be posted immediately after big decisions land.For the four blockbusters that arrived on Thursday and Monday — on affirmative action, immigration, public corruption and abortion — we had a total of 12 versions ready to go.That was partly a consequence of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.His absence meant we had to be ready for 4-4 deadlocks in several cases in addition to wins and losses.In the abortion case, I also prepared a version in which the court sent the case back to the lower courts for more proceedings, a prospect raised during oral arguments in March by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.Starting just before 10 o’clock both mornings, perhaps 30 reporters crammed into the court’s public information office.
