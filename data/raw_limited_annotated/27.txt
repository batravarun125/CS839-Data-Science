Sometimes companies sue departing employees, but those cases are the exception.“It’s not about the lawsuit, but about the far larger chilling effect,” said Matthew Marx.In 2008, Brian Connolly, an engineer with years of experience writing software for medical devices, joined a start-up developing diagnostic technology to identify biohazards, First Light Biosciences.After the financial crisis hit, the start-up laid off 12 of its 14 employees, including Mr. Connolly.Shortly after meeting with a new company, Mr. Connolly got a call from his previous employer, telling him the noncompete prohibited him from joining any company in diagnostic devices, even if the application and the technology were different.This time, a bill has emerged from a House committee, and the <location>Massachusetts</location> speaker, Robert A. DeLeo, has pledged to bring reform legislation to a vote soon.Lori A. Ehrlich, a <location>Massachusetts</location> representative who has sought to curb noncompete agreements, said, “We’re trying to balance a situation where workers have so much less power than the corporations that employ them.” If a bill passes the House, approval in the State Senate is likely.Gov.Charlie Baker, a Republican, is taking a wait-and-see stance.This year, EMC and the trade group have said they are willing to compromise.To a point.The House bill, as it emerged from the legislative committee, would require companies to explain noncompete agreements clearly and limit them to one year.It would also prohibit noncompetes for certain categories of employees like hourly workers, summer interns and college students.And it would require companies to pay former employees 50 percent of their salary during the period of the noncompete contract.If both sides agree, they could negotiate higher or lower rates.Christopher P. Geehern, an executive vice president of Associated Industries, said his group would support legislation but only if the compensation provision was removed.But the compensation requirement, proponents say, is what gives companies a market incentive to prune their noncompete practices.It was one of the principal recommendations in the Treasury Department report this year.The compensation requirement is the linchpin in the legislation for the EMC union organizing campaign and for venture capitalists.“It’s crucial because it will stop most noncompetes from being enforced,” said Rich Miner, a general partner for Google Ventures in <location>Cambridge</location>.
