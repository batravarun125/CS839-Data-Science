<location>England</location> — No matter what players say in front of a microphone, there is no shortage of schadenfreude in professional tennis.In a sport where the big spoils do not trickle down far, one fewer competitor at the top means more trophies and goodies for those who remain.But if you mention Juan Martín del Potro to most of the game’s leading men, their expressions do not lie.There is usually a slight wince, sometimes even a full shake of the head.There is genuine, unmistakable sympathy and the feeling that no champion — not even the one who once crushed all those groundstroke winners past them — deserves to have to deal with this.In the men’s game, del Potro is the great lost talent of this bright and shiny tennis decade.He is the consistent and huge hitter from <location>Tandil</location>, <location>Argentina</location>, who could have made the Big Four into the Big Five or — who knows?— maybe even reshaped the Big One (in this Novak Djokovic moment) into the Big Two.And so it was yet another bittersweet experience to watch del Potro back on court on Tuesday when he made his return after a three-year absence and three operations on his left wrist.“The gentle giant has been sorely missed,” said Patrick McEnroe, the former <location>United States</location> Davis Cup captain.But this first-round match — his first in a Grand Slam tournament since January 2014 — turned out to be more sweet than sour in the end.Del Potro, still crushing forehands and serves, though no longer crushing backhands, took out Stéphane Robert of <location>France</location>, 6-1, 7-5, 6-0.Now comes the giant and not-so-gentle step up: a match with the fourth-seeded Stan Wawrinka, who has matured into a two-time Grand Slam singles champion.Del Potro beat the best of the moment to win his only Grand Slam title, defeating Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer back to back to win the 2009 <location>United States</location> Open at age 20.But the next year, del Potro required an operation on his right wrist, and he has needed three more on the left in the last 27 months, the most recent in June 2015.“He had the game to take it to all the Big Four,” McEnroe said.Del Potro took it to Djokovic in his last  appearance, losing a five-set classic in the 2013 semifinals that was long on baseline acrobatics and mutual respect.And it would come as no surprise if he gave Wawrinka quite a scare.A second-round duel between Grand Slam singles champions is rare in the age of 32 seeds and prize hoarding among a small ruling class, although there have been high-profile clashes at this early stage.Jimmy Connors lost to Ivan Lendl in the second round of the 1992 Open in what turned out to be the 40-year-old Connors’s last match.“I couldn’t be more proud of Juan Martín,” said Dr. Richard Berger, del Potro’s surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in <location>Rochester</location>, Minn. Berger called del Potro “a poster child for an unbreakable faith in his recovery and a dogged determination to come back, including modifying his swing, one of the most difficult things for a champion to do.” Del Potro, working on a trial basis with Andy Murray’s former coach Dani Vallverdu, has been near his breaking point, nonetheless.He considered retirement at the end of last season, but he chose to keep fighting through the pain and the mental blocks.“There is a lot of apprehension that the pain is going to come back, even if it’s not there,” Berger said Tuesday in a telephone interview.“It’s the fear that oh, if I mis-hit or I overhit, I’m going to end up with the same thing again.
