“Their work is special, but they should not be isolated.” In recent decades, Dr. Feilacher has played a large role in guiding the evolution of the Gugging art complex.The institution grew out of an earlier psychiatric hospital, where, starting in the mid-1950s, for diagnostic purposes, the psychiatrist Leo Navratil (1921-2006) asked his patients to make drawings.The character and quality of their handiwork and imagery caught his attention, and he began focusing more specifically on what would now be called art psychotherapy.Later, Dr. Navratil corresponded with Dubuffet, who in the 1940s had begun researching and promoting the hard-to-classify works of self-taught artists.Dubuffet described their output as art brut, French for raw art, referring to the sense of unfettered creative energy they conveyed.Dr. Navratil introduced Dubuffet to Hauser’s drawings, which the artist considered definitive examples of Art Brut.In 1965, the psychiatrist published the book “Schizophrenia and Art” in which he examined the relationship between schizophrenia and artistic expression, noting that making art could play a role in the healing process.He went on to establish a center for art and psychotherapy at the hospital, where 18 male patients resided and made art.Among them were Hauser, Franz Kernbeis (born in 1935) and Oswald Tschirtner (1920-2007).Later, August Walla (1936-2001), who became known for text-and-image paintings and murals that expressed a polytheistic outlook, also moved in.In time, Dr. Feilacher became Dr. Navratil’s assistant and then his successor, transforming the still clinically oriented Center for Art and Psychotherapy into an artists’ community, renaming it the House of Artists and placing a new emphasis on the artistic creativity of its residents rather than on their mental illnesses.Taking a socio-therapeutic approach, the reborn facility stopped using the word “patients” in the mid-1980s to describe its program’s participants.In 1994, Gallery Gugging was established as a venue for the presentation and sale of the Gugging artists’ works.The gallery’s director, Nina Katschnig, said it has “working relationships” with other galleries, including RiccoMaresca Gallery in <location>New York</location>, which has exhibited works by such Gugging artists as Leopold Strobl and Günther Schützenhöfer.At a sold-out show there this spring, Mr. Strobl’s pencil drawings on paper sold for $4,000 or more.Along with the museum, the gallery, the artists’ house and a gift shop, Art Brut Center Gugging is home to Atelier Gugging, a studio in which some of its associated artists work.The studio is also open for use by visitors.“You don’t necessarily have to come make paintings or drawings, as long as you come to explore your creative potential and make something artistic,” Dr. Feilacher said.“That’s what this atelier — and this entire art center — is all about.”
