Mr. García was a Ph.D. student in physics at <location>Berkeley</location> before joining Goldman Sachs to model prices for credit derivatives.He moved to <location>Silicon Valley</location> to perform the same magic in valuing the attention of internet users.And it is the explosion of digital advertising that has fed the emergence of the most recent crop of internet giants.In the course of describing his path from ad-tech start-ups to ad-targeting product manager at Facebook, Mr. García provides fascinating insights into the nature of the online and offline advertising worlds – both regarding what has changed and what has stayed stubbornly the same.Two aspects in these central lessons make “chaos monkeys” a particularly compelling read, despite its faults.First, Mr. García is not just a keen observer of corporate and social culture, but a thoughtful business and policy analyst armed with a highly refined detector for pretentious nonsense.Well before the investor Peter Thiel was revealed as the secret backer of the lawsuit that put Gawker into bankruptcy, Mr. García was writing that “the tech start-up scene, for all its pretensions of transparency, principled innovation, and a counterculture renouncement of pressed shirts and staid social convention, is actually a surprisingly reactionary crowd.” Even where Mr. García completely mangles the facts – as he does for instance in describing the mechanics of the Facebook initial public offering – he manages to draw multiple fresh insights that somehow feel directionally correct.And in contrast to the self-serving verdicts rendered on his allies and enemies, his broader conclusions seem well balanced.The world he inhabited, Mr. García reflects, “is no worse than traditional industry and politics, but certainly no better either.” Which brings us to the second reason “chaos monkeys” is a must-read.It matters.Mr. García is providing tools to honestly deconstruct a corner of the world that has amassed breathtaking cultural, economic and political influence, and not always for the good.Fully 60 percent of Harvard Business School graduates now go to work at companies with fewer than 500 employees.A fuller conversation is required before we rejoice that the invidious hegemony of Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company and hedge funds as the resting place for our best and brightest graduates has been replaced with early-stage tech companies.At the least, readers of “chaos monkeys” will think twice before taking at face value tech leaders’ high-minded arguments for refusing to assist our national security apparatus in fighting terrorist threats.Even in the area of advertising, important social and public policy questions are implicated.The greatest danger of “chaos monkeys” is that it could suffer the same fate as many equally prescient cautionary tales: It is appreciated less as trenchant social criticism and more as a how-to manual.Such is the irresistible pull of <location>Silicon Valley</location> that I fear the manuscript will be pored over mainly for clues to getting a job at Facebook or having a venture selected by the Y combinator.If that is the case, we all may want to join Mr. García on his boat and just sail away.
