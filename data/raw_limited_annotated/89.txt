With the birds, the tundra is melting, and global warming is beginning to take over.” Mr. Krause is a polymathic musician who performed with the folk group the Weavers and helped introduce the Moog synthesizer to pop music — including songs by the doors and Van Morrison — and film scores.He hears natural sounds with a studio producer’s ear and is dismissive of scientists who focus on only one species at a time.singling out one bird in a habitat is “like trying to understand the magnificence of symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin player out of the orchestra and hearing just that one part,” he said.“You’ve got to hear the whole thing.” In 2014, at the Cheltenham Festival in <location>England</location>, Mr. Krause and the composer Richard presented the debut of a symphony composed for orchestra and Mr. Krause’s recordings from the natural world.Last year, that music was used for “Biophony,” a ballet performed at Jacob’s Pillow.In <location>Paris</location> exhibition, curated by Hervé Chandès, the general director of the Cartier Foundation, is the most extensive visual response to Mr. Krause’s work yet.For the show, the foundation commissioned an original work by the <location>New York</location> based Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang, who works with gunpowder on paper.Mr. Cai made a 60-foot-long mural of horses at a watering hole by lighting the gunpowder until the images were burned into the paper.“It’s so amazing to me,” Mr. Krause said.“It looks like the caves at Lascaux.” There are also black-and-white photographs of dioramas at the American Museum of Natural History in <location>New York</location>, taken by Hiroshi Sugimoto, and photographs of birds by the Japanese photographer Manabu Miyazaki, who uses robotic cameras.Mr. Krause, who lives in <location>California</location>, began to study bioacoustics after working on the soundtrack to the 1979 film “Apocalypse Now.” Like many involved with that movie, he said he was hired and fired by the director, Francis Ford Coppola, multiple times.“A lot of people were kind of destroyed by that process,” Mr. Krause said.“I got tired of that whole scene and I decided I didn’t want to do it anymore.” He also finds the natural world therapeutic.“I have a terrible case of A.D.H.D.,” Mr. Krause said.“Forget medication, forget therapy — the only thing that works for me is going out into a field and putting on a pair of earphones and listening to natural sound.”
