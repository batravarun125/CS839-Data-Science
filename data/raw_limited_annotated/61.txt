But the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr., was not a critical player in the drama.He was only one of many senior officials involved in managing the crisis, and was briefed after his dinner.There were many other senior White House, State Department and Pentagon officials, both in <location>Washington</location> and overseas, dealing with the crisis throughout the night.An independent inquiry in December 2012, among others, came to a similar conclusion.That report faulted State Department officials in <location>Washington</location> for ignoring requests from the American Embassy in <location>Tripoli</location>, <location>Libya</location>, for more guards at the <location>Benghazi</location> mission and for failing to make sufficient safety upgrades.As security in <location>Libya</location> worsened in the summer of 2012, the State Department remained committed to a security strategy to deploy a modest American security force and then increasingly rely on trained <location>Libyan</location> personnel to protect American diplomats.That strategy, which had been set a year earlier after the fall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s government, failed.Warning signs were indeed flashing red for months before the attack.The Obama administration received intelligence reports that Islamic extremist groups were operating training camps in the mountains near <location>Benghazi</location>.By June, the city had experienced a string of assassinations, as well as attacks on a British envoy’s motorcade.Mr. Stevens emailed his superiors in <location>Washington</location> in August, alerting them to “a security vacuum” in the city.
