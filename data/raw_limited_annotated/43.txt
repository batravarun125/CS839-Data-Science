Under the proposal, Medicare might set a standard payment rate for a group of “therapeutically similar drug products,” or pay less for an expensive drug where a less costly alternative was available.However, cancer specialists say that for some treatments, no low-cost alternatives are available.The administration could address some of the concerns by reducing the scope of its test, or by making it easier for doctors and patients to obtain exceptions to Medicare’s “value-pricing policy.” While Dr. Conway said the administration would make adjustments in the final rule, he refused to be pinned down on specifics.When asked by a Democrat why the administration had proposed “such a large, expansive demonstration,” Dr. Conway said, “You have to have a sufficiently large sample so that you can evaluate the model.” Part B drugs are often administered in doctors’ offices or hospital outpatient departments.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of <location>Utah</location> and chairman of the Finance Committee, said that many doctors, especially those in rural areas and small medical groups, could lose money buying drugs under the administration’s proposal.If they no longer provide the drugs, he said, patients might have to travel to hospital clinics to get the infusions and injections.In a separate action, the Obama administration on Tuesday unveiled a pilot program to speed the review of patent applications for drugs that mobilize the body’s immune system to fight cancer.Such immunotherapies are among the most expensive medicines approved for sale in recent years, with annual costs exceeding $100,000 in some cases, but they have also shown great promise, scientists say.In a notice to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register, Michelle K. Lee, the director of the Patent and Trademark Office, said her agency would expedite the review of immunotherapies that “destroy cancerous cells” or prevent their growth.To qualify for this special status, drug makers must be conducting clinical trials of the new treatments.Ms. Lee, who is also an under secretary of commerce, said the pilot program was meant to advance the cancer “moonshot” initiative led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.In the last year, dozens of cancer specialists have complained of exorbitant prices for drugs, including some that seem miraculous and others that extend lives by only a few months.Many of the drugs are covered under Part B of Medicare.
