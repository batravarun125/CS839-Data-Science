At 1:40 a.m., three hours to the minute after the game was paused, the tarp was turned over in left field, ready to be rerolled.Girardi, having removed his jersey, examined the infield as Banister trailed close behind and Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman strolled around the perimeter.Brett Gardner stayed in the Yankees’ dugout, arms folded, looking agitated.Eventually, the outlines of the batters’ boxes were repainted white, and the Yankees’ fielders began tossing along the first-base line while Barry Manilow’s “I Made It Through the Rain” played through the stadium’s sound system.When play resumed at 2:15 a.m. Tuesday, the details of the early innings were all but forgotten.The Yankees had overcome a rocky start by Ivan Nova, who had allowed four runs in five innings.Rangers starter Chi Chi Gonzalez had fared no better, though, and the Yankees had tagged him for five runs and 10 hits in five innings.Leading the charge were Carlos Beltran and Mark Teixeira.Hours after the Yankees announced that Alex Rodriguez would sit against a right-handed starter for the second straight day, Beltran moved into the designated hitter slot and picked up three hits, scoring two runs.Teixeira homered for the second consecutive game among his three hits, and he, too, scored twice.When the ninth inning resumed, as cleaning crews were already well into their work collecting debris in the upper level, the Rangers could be heard cheering on Choo.Their spirits had been lifted after hours of idleness and uncertainty, once they were informed that the game would be resumed.“I wanted to win so bad today, because I don’t think it was fair for where they called it, the game,” Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre said.“We were playing the whole game in the rain, and to stop it right there in the ninth inning when we were trying to cook something, I didn’t think it was fair.” The encouragement for Choo was ultimately to no avail.Kirby Yates replaced Chapman and threw two strikes past Choo for the first out.Yates, however, failed to remain sharp.He proceeded to hit three batters in a four-run inning for the Rangers.Beltre’s bases-loaded single drove in two runs, putting <location>Texas</location> ahead to stay, 7-6.Among those few still standing in the crowd were Beltre’s children.In the bottom of the inning, the Yankees’ Starlin Castro beat out a throw by Elvis Andrus at shortstop for an infield single.Or so it appeared.The Rangers challenged the call, delaying the game another minute and 14 seconds.As with most stops in the game, this one was questionable — Castro was ruled safe.Four batters later, with runners on the corners and two outs, Jacoby Ellsbury flied out to left field, ending a contest that officially lasted 3 hours 43 minutes.At last, 7 hours 39 minutes after the scheduled start time, this game had a final score, like the 10 others that had long ago earned their “F’s” on the Yankee Stadium scoreboard: Rangers 9, Yankees 6.
