Ms. Hughes wrote on June 12 that the Fire Department had planned another inspection to make sure the problem was corrected, but it had not yet taken place at the time of the shooting.During the nightclub siege, officers went into pulse several times to bring out stranded survivors, while callers reported that they were still hiding or trapped in various bathrooms, an attic, an office, a dressing room.The incident log shows that they called repeatedly to report casualties and gunfire, warn that their phone batteries were dying, and express their dread at sounds indicating that the gunman may have been approaching.Some even called from the bathroom where the gunman was holed up to tell police what he had said and what he looked like.“Subj in restroom whispering please help,” a dispatcher wrote.A few times, callers went silent or their calls went dead, leaving dispatchers no way of knowing if they were still alive.At 2:35 a.m., Mr. Mateen called 911 himself to claim responsibility for the attack, and declared allegiance to the Islamic State, the F.B.I.has said.The incident logs show the police trying to pin down the number and location of people still trapped inside pulse, figure out which bathroom the gunman was in, and determine how serious a threat they were facing.Near the beginning, a caller reported (correctly) that the gunman had an assault rifle, while another reported (incorrectly) that there might be multiple shooters.At 2:51 a.m., when Mr. Mateen was on the phone with a police negotiator, the F.B.I.has said, word came that took the potential danger to another level: “Shooter saying poss explosives in the parking lot,” and a few minutes later in the same call, “Subj is saying that he is a terrorist and has several bombs strapped to him in the downstairs female restroom.” In addition to the gunman’s own statements, several entries show the people trapped inside confirming that he appeared to have bombs, which turned out to be untrue.At 4:21 a.m., the police rescued the people in a dressing room by pulling an air-conditioning unit out of an exterior wall, and some of those people warned that the gunman planned to strap explosive vests to four hostages.It was that information, officials said, that had persuaded them to make the final assault on the club, using explosives and an armored vehicle to punch through a wall.“SWAT breached,” the log says at 5:02 a.m. At 5:15, as the officers traded gunfire with Mr. Mateen, it notes, “Shots fired north bathroom,” and less than a minute later, “Subj down.” An entry just before 5:18 a.m., using a police term for armed, states, “Bad guy down strapped.”
