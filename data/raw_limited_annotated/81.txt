After Alphonza’s death, his mother, Jenaii van Doten, said she had been strict with him, ordering her son, who was weeks from his high school graduation, to be home every night by 10 o’clock.Yet he was shot just after 8 p.m. “It wasn’t even curfew time,” his mother said in 2013.Mr. Bloomberg seized upon Alphonza’s killing as an example of the toll gun violence was having on the streets of <location>New York</location> and the role the Police Department’s stop-and-frisk tactics had in stemming the violence.Ms. van Doten responded in an essay in The Daily News that Alphonza had been stopped and frisked.She argued the contentious policy was “not working the way they intended,” but that she ultimately supported it.“Some people are saying stop-and-frisks are terrorizing our kids,” Ms. van Doten wrote.“Maybe my son wouldn’t have been shot if the right kids were terrorized.”
