There was no money involved at all.Did he offer?It wasn’t offered, but I wouldn’t have taken it.That would’ve cheapened the whole thing — this building of an amazing bridge between aesthetic realms that are feeding off of the same information.Recently we’ve seen rap interact with contemporary art more, as in Drake’s using James Turrell-inspired visuals for “Hotline Bling,” and Jay Z working with Marina Abramovic for “Picasso Baby.” Is there any part of you that feels icky for being sucked into this world of celebrity?First of all, a lot of art that makes the crossover into hip-hop is not interesting to me in the least — and not so interesting to Kanye, at this point.For Kanye, who lives in this world of celebrity and fame, the way I understand him now is that he’s much more like Andy Warhol.He said one time, “I am Warhol” out of frustration.But he’s like an exploded internet version of Warhol allowing these celebs to hang themselves with their own words while he sits there and says, “That’s fabulous.” Warhol was a mirror for the times.When Kanye goes through all these shenanigans, he’s mirroring the times.He said it himself: It’s performance art.His whole life is performance art.Did you recognize everyone portrayed in the video?I did, except for some of the hip-hop people.That seems to be the thing people are focusing on more — I’m sure he did it to be incendiary — but the real subject of the video is that many of these people in the bed are repulsive.But everything about the video kept me at bay in regard to making a judgment on them.Every time I would think a thought like that, I would see them sleeping and vulnerable, like babies.We’re all the same.They’re just famous.Lena Dunham wrote that the video “feels informed and inspired by the aspects of our culture that make women feel unsafe even in their own beds, in their own bodies.” What do you make of that?Artists are not saints.They’re not people whose first obligation is moral correctness.As much as I like Dunham and appreciate her, art goes to dangerous places.And this is not to sound like Donald Trump, whom I loathe, but if you want to make it amenable to a certain political class or agenda, what a disaster that would be.It’s like saying, ‘Hitchcock, that guy must’ve really loved killing women.’ Or Dostoyevsky — ‘I don’t like that guy very much.’ It’s horrible to look at, horrible to hear, but there’s also the kernel of salvation.That tension between those two things is where art functions.
