My introduction to the holy month of Ramadan, during which observant Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, was a bowl of harira soup.It was served to me one evening in an antiques shop in southern <location>Morocco</location>.The hospitable owner of the shop knew that most of his customers had been fasting all day, so he passed little bowls of cinnamon-scented harira.It is what happens to dried legumes — lentils, chickpeas, fava beans — when they are simmered slowly with onion, tomato and saffron, until the various components collapse into a delightfully spiced, velvet-textured whole.The soup is traditionally the first thing one eats to break the fast, every night, along with a few dates and beghrir ( sweet semolina pancakes).A large dinner follows, and then a large morning meal is eaten before sunrise, when fasting begins again.I have been making versions of that soup at home for years now.It is endlessly appealing, and variations, even in <location>Morocco</location>, are the norm, from house to house and region to region.It has a lot of things going for it: the soup tastes best a few hours, or even a day, after it is made, so cooking it in advance is ideal, and it’s perfect for a crowd, so making a big pot of it makes sense.Last but not least, everyone loves it.Recipes for harira typically call for lamb (in some cases, chicken) but usually in rather minuscule quantities, say, a half pound for an entire pot, cut into small pieces.It is added more as a flavoring than to have meat in the soup.Some cooks add a lamb shank to the simmering pot, or a meaty lamb bone, or some use broth instead of water.
