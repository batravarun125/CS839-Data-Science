The remarkable consistency and beauty of these wines make monte bello America’s greatest cabernet sauvignon, in my judgment as The Times’s wine critic.Over its history, Ridge has taken an almost singular path to greatness.It was founded by three scientists from the Stanford Research Institute, who in 1959 purchased 80 acres on ridge, including an old vineyard and a winery that dated back to the 19th century but had largely been abandoned.In 1969, they hired Mr. Draper, who had grown up on a farm outside <location>Chicago</location>, graduated from Stanford and most recently had been making wine in <location>Chile</location>.Mr. Draper’s winemaking philosophy centered on what he called “preindustrial techniques,” developed from 19th-century European and American texts.Like these older winemakers, he relied on natural yeasts for fermentation, used minimal amounts of sulfur dioxide as a stabilizer and otherwise did as little as possible beyond gently guiding the transformation of grape juice into wine.He applied this, but also to the zinfandels, many of which were made at <location>Sonoma</location> facility.Mr. Vernon, who joined in 1998 and has been the president and chief operating officer the last seven years, will take over as chief executive.Mr. Baugher, who has made wine  since 2001, will also become monte bello’s chief operating officer, while Mr. Olney, who has been winemaker since 2001, will continue and become chief operating officer there.Mr. Gates, the Ridge vineyard manager, will continue as senior vice president for vineyard operations.“I feel I am passing on our vineyards and estate to members of my own family,” Mr. Draper said.
