<location>HAARLEM</location>, the <location>Netherlands</location> — When the Syrian Army tried to forcibly recruit him, Omar Nabhan, 27, faced a terrible choice: become a soldier in a war he did not want to join, or face imprisonment.He and his wife decided to flee their home in <location>Aleppo</location> instead.So it is a cruel twist that — after crossing the <location>Aegean Sea</location> in a boat that nearly capsized, and trekking through the lake and then up to the <location>Netherlands</location> — they have ended up living in a prison anyway.They are two of more than 300 asylum seekers who have been placed in De Koepel, one of 13 former prisons and jails that the <location>Netherlands</location> is using to house migrants and refugees while their applications are processed.Never ideal, the repurposing of empty prisons as shelters was initially accepted as an emergency response to the sudden influx of migrants and refugees from <location>Syria</location>.</location>Iran</location>.<location>Afghanistan</location> and other countries late last year.But it has become increasingly controversial as wait times for housing and the processing of asylum applications stretch out for months.For critics and some of those housed in the former jails, a stopgap solution has taken on an air of permanence and the feeling of actual incarceration.“Prisons obviously don’t provide the sense of privacy and independence to prepare for integration into Dutch society, or for their return and reintegration into their own societies,” said Jasper Kuipers, deputy director of the Dutch Council for Refugees, an advocacy group partly funded by the government.“They’re not suited for that.” When about 58,000 migrants poured into the <location>Netherlands</location> last year, the country did not have enough shelters for everyone, Klaas Dijkhoff, the state secretary for security and justice, said in an interview.He looked at various options, including empty office space and tent camps.But, exceptionally for almost any country, the <location>Netherlands</location> had a surplus of unoccupied jail cells because of plunging crime rates, and had even been renting out cells to other countries, like <location>Belgium</location> and <location>Norway</location>.When the asylum seekers arrived, part of a tide of more than a million migrants who entered <location>Europe</location> last year, the empty detention centers seemed like a practical option, Mr. Dijkhoff said.“At the time we did it, the influx was so high that if at the end of the day we had enough beds for the people who were coming in, we were proud,” he said.While the prisons are “not five-star facilities,” Mr. Dijkhoff added, they do have some “clear benefits,” including kitchens and private rooms.At many, “you even have a gym, or you have an outside court to play football or other sports, which you don’t have in a repurposed office building, for example,” he said.“And most times, you have more space.” On a recent day, Mr. Nabhan, formerly an engineer at a security company, and his wife, Chena Kabane, 26, sat on their bunk beds, punching their thumbs into their smartphones while the heavy steel door that offers them a measure of privacy was left open so they could use the wireless internet.For the last five months, when Ms. Kabane has needed to bathe, Mr. Nabhan has stood guard so men do not walk in on her.The couple cannot cook their own food, but receive microwaved portions.They have not been able to sleep in the same bed.Instead, he puts his mattress on the floor next to her bottom bunk.Still, they have tried to remain appreciative and optimistic.“At the start, it felt like a prison, even though we are free to come and go,” Mr. Nabhan said.“But when we look at people who are staying in tents, we know we have good luck.” Others are less sanguine.
