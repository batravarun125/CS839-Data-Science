The group knew that once their job was finished, they, too, would be executed, so they developed an escape plan.About half of the group spent 76 days digging a tunnel in their holding pit by hand and with spoons they found among the bodies.On April 15, 1944 — the last night of Passover when they knew the night would be darkest — the brigade crawled through the two-foot-square tunnel entrance and through to the forest.The noise alerted the guards, who pursued the prisoners with guns and dogs.Of the 80, 12 managed to escape; 11 of them survived the war and went on to tell their stories, according to the researchers.Dr. Freund and his team used the information from survivors’ accounts to search for the tunnel.Rather then excavate and disturb the remains, he and his team used two noninvasive tools — electrical resistivity tomography and ground penetrating radar.Electrical resistivity tomography is like an M.R.I.for the ground; it provides a clear picture of the subsurface.It uses electricity to identify stones, metal and clay as well as soil disturbances like those made by digging.“We used the tool to pinpoint the locations where people most likely tunneled through,” said Paul Bauman a geophysicist with WorleyParsons, an Australian engineering company, who handled the tomography tool.“We’re highly confident we’ve identified exactly where the tunnel is.” With the tool, they also found a previously unknown pit which they think is the largest ever discovered in the area.They estimate that it might have contained as many as 10,000 bodies.The other tool, the ground penetrating radar, uses FM radio waves to scan about 10 feet under the surface.“What we are doing is using those FM radio waves that people listen to in their car and we’re putting them into the ground,” said Harry Jol, professor of geology and anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.“We’re getting reflections off the archaeological features or landscapes in the subsurface so we can image what’s happening.” The team also used the ground penetrating radar to search for the Great Synagogue of Vilnius, which was destroyed by the Nazis.“The Holocaust is so overwhelming that we only really look at the end of the story — and that isn’t the whole story,” said Jon Seligman, an archaeologist, who also led the team.“The whole story is the history of Jews who lived in this area for many, many centuries.” Before World War II, <location>Vilnius</location> was a bustling Jewish center with more than 100,000 people.When the Soviets took over <location>Lithuania</location>, they erected an elementary school.
