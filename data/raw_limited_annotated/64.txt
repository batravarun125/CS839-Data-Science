Quinnipiac’s poll found that 61 percent think that the campaign is increasing hatred and prejudice in the <location>United States,</location> and 67 percent of those who think that attribute it to the presumptive Republican nominee.“It would be difficult to imagine a less flattering from-the-gut reaction to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,” said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll.“Voters find themselves in the middle of a meanspirited, scorched-earth campaign between two candidates they don’t like.” Mrs. Clinton is the heavy favorite among women, black voters, Hispanics and younger voters.Mr. Trump leads with men, white voters and those who are over the age of 65.Voters view Mr. Trump as being stronger on the economy and better suited to handle terrorism, while Mrs. Clinton is seen as more trusted by voters on immigration and handling international crises.Mrs. Clinton also gets higher marks when it comes to being prepared to be president and for her intelligence, but Mr. Trump beats her on leadership and honesty.
