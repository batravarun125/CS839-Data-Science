After Carlos Beltran left Tuesday night’s game against the Rangers with tightness in his right hamstring, a pack of reporters circled around his locker following the Yankees’ 7-1 loss, awaiting an update.Alex Rodriguez suddenly walked past his locker, next to Beltran’s, his hands folded in front of his body, smiling.The members of the news media at <location>New York</location> did not flinch.After a few silent moments, Rodriguez walked off without attracting a crowd.It could have been cunning timing, but it was also indicative of the Yankees’ offensive hierarchy.Without Beltran, who at 39 has surprisingly led the team in virtually every major offensive category, the Yankees’ season would precipitously spiral downward.Rodriguez has been mired in a long slump.“It’s not major,” Beltran said of his hamstring.“I’m happy about that.” Still, because of his age, there was concern that Beltran had limped off the field after a seemingly innocuous play.In his first at-bat, Beltran lined a ball toward the left-field wall.As Rangers left fielder Ryan Rua misread the carom, fans began booing Beltran when he did not stretch the sharp hit into a double.Moments later, the misplaced ire dissipated as Beltran took off his batting gloves and walked off the field, replaced by pinch-runner Rob Refsnyder.Beltran said that he felt a pull and a knot in his hamstring, which was still sore after the game.A magnetic resonance imaging exam was negative, and he was listed as day to day.“I was concerned,” said Beltran, whose treatment over the next few days could include massage and acupuncture.
