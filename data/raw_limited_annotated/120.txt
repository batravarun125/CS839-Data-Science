This weekend, the haute couture shows start in <location>Paris</location> — and a handful of new names will be welcomed to the fold.The members of <location>Paris’s</location> Chambre Syndicale have picked five guest designers to join the calendar for the season and stage shows.(Also of note: Giles Deacon, who set aside his ready-to-wear line for fall 2016, will be holding a series of presentations.)Here’s a rundown of the upcoming crop of participants at couture, which runs July 3 to 7.The Dutch designer was previously invited to show at Couture Week in 2011, and the otherworldly garments that she sends down the runway on the ready-to-wear schedule are arguably more at home under the auspices of the Chambre Syndicale.For this collection, “I have been exploring the study of cymatics, which visualizes sound waves as evolving geometric patterns,” she says.“The collection shows a variation of organic and three-dimensional structures, new materials and techniques and biomorphic volumes.” She identifies a “dewdrop dress,” which consists of thousands of crystals embedded in a transparent silicone liquid, as a particular challenge.“Getting the material to have the right stretch, thickness and drapiness was a process of continuous experiments and fine tuning.” The fashion collective founded by Demna Gvasalia in 2014 (who, last October, was appointed the creative director of Balenciaga) will be presenting the Vetements version of couture.It’s reportedly a series of designer collaborations with brands like Hanes, Reebok and Levi’s, for women and men, and is being billed as a springsummer 2017 collection (though it won’t be on a see nowbuy now timeline, but a regular delivery schedule).The <location>Pompeii</location>-born designer’s already ornate and skillfully tailored dresses lend themselves nicely to the French notion of haute couture.
