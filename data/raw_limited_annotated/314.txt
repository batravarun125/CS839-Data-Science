“Although it is understandable that propaganda might have been exaggerated back then for the sake of encouraging the military and the public to resist Japan’s invasion, by now people want to know the historic truth,” he wrote.One of the four lawyers who defended Mr. Hong, Wang Xing, said that from a purely legal perspective Mr. Hong should not have lost the case.“The court’s verdict has obvious flaws, because the plaintiffs never detailed which parts of Mr. Hong’s articles were incorrect,” Mr. Wang said in an interview.Still, he said he did not expect the appeal, to be heard by the <location>Beijing</location> Second Intermediate Court, to be decided in Mr. Hong’s favor either.“This is clearly a political trial carried out under political pressure,” said Mr. Wang, a partner at Zebo, a law firm in <location>Beijing</location>.“This is about freedom of speech and academia, but the court ruled against it.It shows the authorities’ lack of confidence.” Mr. Wang also said that his own comments on the case on Weibo could not be reposted and that another one of Mr. Hong’s lawyers, Zhou Ze, had been unable to post comments about the case on his Weibo account.Mr. Hong is not the only historian who has challenged the enshrined narrative of the mountain heroes.Jiang Keshi, a Chinese professor at University in <location>Japan</location> who studies modern Japanese history, says the official <location>Chinese</location> version has major flaws.Based on multiple records that Mr. Jiang found in <location>Japan</location>, he said, no Japanese soldier died in the fighting with the five at the mountain.“There were dozens who fought,” Mr. Jiang said.“But no deaths, just injuries.” However, the Chinese version, which first appeared in 1941 in a Communist Party newspaper, asserted that many Japanese died.And in 2005, an article in People’s Daily, the party newspaper, commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Japanese surrender, said that the five Langya heroes shot and killed or wounded at least 90 Japanese soldiers.“This verdict means that scholarship is being suppressed,” Mr. Jiang said in a telephone interview.“<location>China</location> seals off its historic documents and doesn’t study them.” “Academic freedom in <location>China</location> means you can’t interfere with the state’s and the party’s propaganda interests,” he added.“If you do, you end up like Mr. Hong.”
