“One of the first things I teach is a mermaid’s movements, how it feels to swim with a tail.” If the English word “mermaid” connotes a chaste creature, the French “sirène” brings to mind the deadly seductresses of “The Odyssey,” the Sirens, who sang so beautifully that they enticed sailors to steer their ships onto the rocks and perish.Graduates of Ms. Sardella’s classes may aspire to become Miss Mermaid France.This year’s competition had seven entrants, who, wearing elegantly colored tails, cavorted in a large pool.The winner will compete in the International mermaiding contest in the autumn at a resort on the Red Sea.Ms. Sardella said that about 500 people took her introductory courses at a hotel in Marseille, with some returning for more advanced instruction.She plans to expand to <location>Monaco</location> and <location>Paris</location>.“Some people come for curiosity,” she said, “some because they have a dream of being a mermaid.”
