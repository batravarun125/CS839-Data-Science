Trump went to a suburb of <location>Pittsburgh</location> called <location>Monessen</location> on Tuesday to talk about the steel industry and talk about trade.The mix of location and topic was uniquely appropriate for a major economic speech, though probably not in the way Mr. Trump apparently intended.“Today I am going to talk about how to make <location>America</location> wealthy again,” he said.“We are going to put <location>American</location>-produced steel back into the backbone of our country.This alone will create massive numbers of jobs.” He’s right that the number of steel industry jobs — more precisely “iron and steel mills and ferroalloy manufacturing,” in government data-speak — is down by 44 percent in the <location>Pittsburgh</location> area since 1990, a span in which the <location>United States</location> entered the North American Free Trade Agreement and engaged in much more extensive trade with <location>China</location>.But two things are worth knowing.Before Nafta was even a gleam in a trade negotiator’s eye, <location>Pittsburgh</location> had already lost the biggest chunk of its steelworking jobs.The culprit in that era was both international competition and the introduction of mini-mills, which allowed the production of steel with far fewer man-hours.Because of that and other technological innovations that improved productivity, total American steel output is about the same now as it was in 1990, even with far fewer workers.That steep contraction in steel production jobs has been more than counterbalanced by a rise in other types of work.The 5,100 steel production jobs lost in <location>Pittsburgh</location> are dwarfed by the 66,000 health care jobs gained in the same time span.<location>Pittsburgh</location> has often been viewed as the very model of a city moving beyond its heavy industrial history to find new prosperity in areas like health care, banking, and professional services.And that shows the fundamental challenge Mr. Trump faces in seeking — as he did in Tuesday’s speech — to put opposition to trade deals at the center of his economic agenda in the presidential race.The economics of nostalgia may capture the hearts of a certain portion of voters.But it is disconnected from the decades-long direction of the <location>United States</location> economy and the interests of the businesses that are historically a crucial part of the Republican coalition.That shift has been one of the more remarkable turns in what has been a remarkable race.
