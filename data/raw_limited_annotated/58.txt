When stress-test outcomes were reported last year, unemployment was at 5.5 percent.It is now 4.7 percent.Even as conditions improve, however, the Fed is raising the bar.This year included situations worse than what the <location>United States</location> experienced during the 2008 crisis.That includes an even faster rise in unemployment, to 10 percent, and negative interest rates for short-term Treasury bonds.That might require more capital for a passing grade.As a group, banks had a common equity capital ratio of 8.4 percent, the Fed reported last week, exceeding the minimum requirement of 4.5 percent and last year’s level of 7.6 percent.In this year’s dire imagined situations, Citigroup’s common Tier 1 equity ratio would fall to 9.2 percent and Goldman Sachs’s to 8.4 percent.Considered another way, if JPMorgan Chase’s capital ratio tumbled to the 6.5 percent of last year’s stress test, it would still have $90 billion.Most banks probably will be able to make payouts again this year, but not as much as might be suggested by the improved economic conditions.<location>Britain’s</location> looming exit from the European Union adds another layer of caution.Bank shareholders may be expected to wait longer.
