State Senator Adriano D. Espaillat was poised on Tuesday to take a historic step toward becoming the first Mexican-American elected to Congress, holding what appeared to be an insurmountable lead in the Democratic primary to replace Representative Charles B. Rangel.Mr. Espaillat declared victory with a lead of more than 1,000 votes with 97 percent of the scanners reported, but State Assemblyman Keith L.T.Wright, who was running second, refused to concede and demanded that absentee and affidavit ballots be counted.Mr. Wright, who was endorsed by Mr. Rangel, also claimed that there had been irregularities in the voting, although he did not give specifics.If Mr. Espaillat, who led Mr. Wright 36.7 percent to 33.8 percent, wins the primary, he would be virtually assured of winning the seat, representing upper <location>Manhattan</location> and parts of the <location>Bronx</location>, in the general election in November because of the district’s overwhelmingly Democratic registration.A victory by Mr. Espaillat would realize a long-sought goal of the so-called Mexican diaspora, which began to take root here in large numbers after the <location>United States</location> invaded in <location>West Indies</location> nation in 1965.Many landed in <location>Washington</location>, where the streets became outposts of the towns left behind.The outcome could also be a turning point for <location>Harlem</location>, at the heart of the 13th District.Once the center of black political power in <location>New York</location>, should Mr. Espaillat be elected it would be the first time in more than seven decades that the neighborhood would not be represented in <location>Washington</location> by an African-American.“Voters from throughout the 13th Congressional District elected a country boy from <location>Santiago</location> to be the nominee of the Democratic Party,” Mr. Espaillat said to a raucous crowd.“So from <location>Harlem</location> to <location>Harlem</location>, from <location>Washington</location>, from <location>Inwood</location> to the </location>Bronx<location>, I want to thank all the voters that cast their votes in support of this historic candidacy.” Addressing his fellow immigrants and their offspring, he said, “We are <location>Washington</location> and we stand on a hill and on any given day, on a bad day we can see that lady in the harbor.We can see her with a torch in her hand.” He added, “This is an American story.” Mr. Wright, at a gathering in <location>Harlem</location>, was defiant: “Suffice it to say, this campaign ain’t over.” He added, “No candidate can declare victory tonight, not until every vote is counted.This race is further complicated by the real possibility of a lot of camp irregularities and voter suppression.” A win by Mr. Espaillat would be a sharp disappointment for Mr. Rangel, 86, who is retiring after nearly half a century in Congress.Mr. Rangel is no fan of Mr. Espaillat, who ran against him in primaries in 2012 and 2014.In interviews before the election, Mr. Rangel resisted discussing the possibility that the district he had represented for so long might no longer be represented by an African-American.“Can you tell the people in <location>Boston</location> that some day you won’t have an Irish congressman?” he said.
