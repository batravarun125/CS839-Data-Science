<location>WASHINGTON</location> — Ending one of the longest, costliest and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history, the House Select Committee on <location>Benghazi</location> issued its final report on Tuesday, finding no new evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in the 2012 attacks in <location>Libya</location> that left four Americans dead.The 800-page report delivered a broad rebuke of the Defense department, the Central intelligence agency and the State department — and the officials who led them — for failing to grasp the acute security risks in <location>Benghazi</location>, and especially for maintaining outposts there that they could not protect.The committee, led by Representative Trey Gowdy, of <location>South Carolina</location>, also harshly criticized an internal State Department investigation that it said had allowed officials like Mrs. Clinton, then the secretary of state, to effectively choose who would examine their actions.In addition, it included some new details and context about the night of the attacks on the American diplomatic compound and reiterated Republicans’ complaints that the Obama administration had sought to thwart the investigation by withholding witnesses and evidence.The report, which included perhaps the most exhaustive chronology of the attacks to date, did not dispute that <location>United States</location> military forces stationed in <location>Europe</location> could not have reached <location>Benghazi</location> in time to rescue the personnel who died — a central finding of previous inquiries.Still, it issued stinging criticism of the overall delay in response and the lack of preparedness on the part of the government.“The assets ultimately deployed by the Defense department in response to the <location>Benghazi</location> attacks were not positioned to arrive before the final, lethal attack,” the committee wrote.“The fact that this is true does not mitigate the question of why the world’s most powerful military was not positioned to respond.” But the lack of any clear finding of professional misconduct or dereliction of duty was certain to fuel further criticism of the length of the investigation — more than two years — and the expense, estimated at more than $7 million.It also bolstered Democrats’ allegations that the inquiry was specifically intended to damage Mrs. Clinton’s presidential prospects.After a campaign stop in <location>Denver</location>, said that the investigation had uncovered nothing to contradict past findings, and that the House committee’s work had assumed a “partisan tinge.” “I’ll leave it to others to characterize this report,” she said, “but I think it’s pretty clear it’s time to move on.” Yet even as Mrs. Clinton seemed eager to press forward, she must still contend with the fallout from the committee’s most significant, if inadvertent, discovery: that she exclusively used a private email server during her four years as secretary of state.That revelation has spurred separate investigations into whether classified material was mishandled, including a continuing inquiry by the F.B.I.In a sign that Mr. Gowdy was also facing pressure from the right, two of the committee’s conservative members, Representatives Jim Jordan of <location>Ohio</location> and Mike Pompeo of <location>Kansas</location>, wrote a 48-page addendum including somewhat harsher criticism of Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration.After the attack, “with the presidential election just 56 days away, rather than tell the American people the truth and increase the risk of losing an election, the administration told one story privately and a different story publicly,” Mr. Jordan and Mr. Pompeo wrote.Technically, the report is not final until the full committee formally votes to accept it, which it is scheduled to do July 8.Among the committee’s chief findings: ■ Despite authorization from President Obama, no American military forces were deployed to <location>Benghazi</location> on the night of the attacks, and Marines stationed in <location>Spain</location> repeatedly received conflicting orders.■ The Libyan forces that helped evacuate Americans from a C.I.A.annex to the <location>Benghazi</location> airport were not part of militias allied with the <location>United States</location>, but were fighters previously loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of <location>Libya</location>.■ Susan E. Rice, then the <location>United States</location> ambassador, made numerous false statements about the <location>Benghazi</location> attack on television that one State Department press officer described in an email as “off the reservation on five networks!” ■ Senior State Department officials — including Mrs. Clinton’s chief of staff, Cheryl D. Mills — exerted too much influence over the Accountability Review Board that conducted the department’s own inquiry, casting doubt on its independence and findings.■ The Obama administration repeatedly sought to obstruct the select committee’s investigation by delaying or refusing to respond to requests for documents and testimony.The committee made scant mention of procedures put in place since the <location>Benghazi</location> attacks, which fundamentally changed the way American embassies and consulates operate.The State Department has taken a maximalist approach to security that some diplomats now say makes it difficult for them to carry out their responsibilities.The Defense Department has increased the number of Marine guards at diplomatic posts and created new crisis-response teams.Democrats on the committee complained that they had been excluded from decisions on the report, and noted that the <location>Benghazi</location> investigation had dragged on longer than the inquiries into the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; the assassination of President John F. Kennedy; the attack on <location>Pearl Harbor</location>; and the response to Hurricane Katrina.
