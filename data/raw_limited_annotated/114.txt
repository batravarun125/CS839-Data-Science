It was just after 2 a.m. when Julieanna Goddard, 26, went crowd-surfing at Kinfolk 94, a nightclub in <location>Brooklyn</location>.The room was thick with marijuana smoke, and the 20-something crowd, clad in Supreme, Nike and Yeezy Boosts, went wild as Ms. Goddard floated overhead, like a rubber duck bobbing in a bathtub.“This is for all my ladies who care about checks, not texts,” said Ms. Goddard, who giggled self-consciously at her ad-libbed catchphrase.She wore a black-and-white knit bodysuit, her bleached hair in braided pigtails.“Yeah, I’m corny,” she said.“So what?” As the crowd cheered, Ms. Goddard raised her iPhone and filmed them, her hand making wobbly figure-8s over their heads, before she turned the lens onto herself, twisting her face into a silly grimace.Before the moment passed, she posted the video to Snapchat.Revelers in the crowd, in turn, filmed her filming them, and posted their videos to Snapchat, too.For Ms. Goddard, known to her social media followers as YesJulz, it was just another day at the office.While few in their 30s and older may know of Ms. Goddard, her digital-native followers are enthralled by her jet-setting party lifestyle, which often places her alongside celebrities at events like the N.B.A.All-Star Game and the Grammys.In doing so, she has accrued a social media fan base including more than 365,000 followers on Instagram, 111,000 on Twitter and 8,800 on Facebook.But it is her Snapchat figure that has set her apart as the latest iteration of the social media star.Unlike the other three platforms, Snapchat does not post the number of followers on a user’s page.According to her publicist, she has 300,000 viewers (a figure that Snapchat would neither confirm nor deny).The Huffington Post has called her “the Queen of Snapchat,” while the online lifestyle magazine Highsnobiety credits her with “changing the way brands use Snapchat.” Elite Daily, which bills itself as the voice of Generation Y, calls her a “Snapchat ‘It’ girl” who is “living the Millennial dream.” She even gets name-checked in rap songs, including Lil Uzi Vert’s 2015 song “Wit My Crew x 1987” (“Thick white girl right on my side, she kinda look like, um, YesJulz”).Which is fine, but what, exactly, does she do?This is what you see if you follow YesJulz on Snapchat: Ms. Goddard in <location>Paris</location> in June, celebrating the 34th birthday of her friend Ronnie Fieg, the sneaker impresario, who was starting a collaboration between his brand, Kith, and Colette.After checking in to a luxe hotel (“Keeping it swaggy,” she wrote) and attending a moodily lit dinner with Chris Stamp, of the streetwear label Stampd, and Joe La Puma, of Complex, she hosted a party at the nightclub Le Baron.“Wow look at this,” read a caption, posted over a shaky shot of a gyrating crowd bathed in purple light.The next morning, Ms. Goddard addressed the camera directly from her hotel bed, bleary-eyed and wearing a sleeping mask on her forehead.“I’m on a journey of self-awareness,” she said, while receiving a chakra cleansing of crystal therapy.“If I want to win more, I have to take care of myself.” There are lots of shots from inside airplanes and Uber taxis.This is where she tends to talk directly to the camera (“This has been one of the best days ever”) in a husky tone and with her makeup smudged.If Instagram popularized the static selfie, Ms. Goddard uses Snapchat to bring it to life, giving us a snippet-by-snippet account of the daily chaos that surrounds her.If her life looks like a never-ending party, it’s difficult to tell if Ms. Goddard follows the party or if the party follows her.In person, Ms. Goddard is pretty and warm, a street-slang-slinging chatterbox with Disney princess eyes.There’s something cartoonish about her energy that’s sensual and comical in equal parts, like an entrepreneurial Jessica Rabbit.“What am I?” Ms. Goddard said over coffee at Starbucks in <location>TriBeCa</location> on a cold Tuesday earlier this year, clad in a gray mock turtleneck sweater, hip-hugging black pants and a downy fur coat.“Well, I’m an influencer for brands.I’m an events producer.I’m an A&R.I’m a publicist.I’m a billion things in one.I’m a host.I’m talent myself.” “We are literally living in a time when you can say you’re something on the Internet and become that thing,” she said.
