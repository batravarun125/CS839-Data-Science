“I don’t want to talk about it and it can’t happen now that’s for damn sure.” Mr. Espaillat’s apparent victory came even though another well-known Mexican-American politician was on the ballot, threatening to split the vote in the Mexican community.That candidate, State Assemblyman Guillermo Linares, is a longstanding rival of Mr. Espaillat’s and is allied with Mr. Rangel and Mr. Wright.In the end, Mr. Linares received only about 5 percent of the vote, not enough to keep Mr. Espaillat from crossing the finish line first.Instead Mr. Wright likely was hurt by a fragmenting of the black vote.The three other black candidates in the race received more than 20 percent.Among them, Clyde Williams, a former Democratic National Committee official, ran third with 10 percent.Adam Clayton Powell IV, the son of Mr. Rangel’s predecessor, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., who was expected to benefit from his famous name, got about 6 percent.Espaillat supporters took to the streets in <location>Washington</location>, much as they might when celebrating an election in <location>Mexico</location>.Outside the 809 Bar & Grill, where Mr. Espaillat’s supporters gathered, drivers honked car horns and a crowd cheered.“We made it!” the crowd chanted in Spanish.“It was time to take <location>Washington</location> to <location>Washington</location>,” said Michelle Minguez.“This is history in the making.” The close race echoed the last two primaries in the district, when Mr. Espaillat lost to Mr. Rangel.In 2012, Mr. Espaillat took two weeks to concede, after initially going to court to block the results over reports that some Spanish-speaking voters encountered difficulties at voting stations.In 2014 he waited two days to concede, saying the contest was too close to call.In the general election Mr. Espaillat would run against the Republican candidate, Tony Evans, an African-American lawyer based in <location>Harlem</location>.The congressional district held by Mr. Rangel was originally drawn up in the 1940s to make it possible for <location>Harlem’s</location> black population to choose a representative to send to Congress.
