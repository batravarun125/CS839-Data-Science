But they could not agree on what success should look like, and ultimately settled for assurances from lawmakers that they could add quality controls after the cap was lifted.In fact, the law repealed a longstanding requirement that the State Department of Education issue yearly reports monitoring charter school performance.At the same time, the law included a provision that seemed to benefit Mr. Huizenga, whose company profits from buying buildings and renting them back to the charters it operates.Earlier that year he had lost a tax appeal in which he argued that a for-profit company should not have to pay taxes on properties leased to schools.The new law granted for-profit charter companies the exemption he had sought.Just as universities were allowed to charter more schools, Gov.Rick Snyder created a state-run district, with new charters, to try to turn around the city’s worst schools.<location>Detroit</location> was soon awash in choice, but not quality.Twenty-four charter schools have opened in the city since the cap was lifted in 2011.Eighteen charters whose existing schools were at or below the district’s dismal performance expanded or opened new schools.The charter school where Ana Rivera sent her two sons, Cesar Chavez Academy, added a second elementary school, even though its existing one fell below 98 percent of schools on the most recent state rankings, in 2014.The Leona Group, the Arizona-based for-profit operator that runs it, also runs some of the worst-performing schools in <location>Detroit</location>.Stanford University’s Center for Research on Education Outcomes, considered the gold standard of measurement by charter school supporters across the country, found that students in the company’s schools grew less academically than students in the neighboring traditional public schools.Ms. Rivera, herself the product of a failing <location>Detroit</location> public high school, knew none of that when she chose the school for her sons.“I had no idea of the education system,” she said.She presumed it was better because it was a charter; it did not get the bad press the public schools do about gangs and violence.Saginaw Valley State University, which chartered Cesar Chavez Academy, defended its decision to allow the school to expand, arguing that many of the students come in without English as a first language, and do better as they move into high school.“They trend positively academically throughout that system,” David Lewis, the director of the university’s charter school office, said.The Stanford data is national and “is not reflective,” he said, of Cesar Chavez.With about $1.1 billion in state tax dollars going to charter schools, those that grant the charters get about $33 million.Those institutions are often far from the schools; one, bay mills Community College, is in <location>Michigan</location>, nearly 350 miles away — as far from <location>Detroit</location>, Me., is from <location>New York</location>. Nationally, some charter school groups praise <location>Michigan</location> for allowing so many institutions to grant charters.But the practice has also allowed bad schools to languish: When universities have threatened to close them, other universities have granted another charter.By 2015, a federal review of a grant application for <location>Michigan</location> charter schools found an “unreasonably high” number of charters among the worst-performing 5 percent of public schools statewide.The number of charters on the list had doubled from 2010 to 2014.“People here had so much confidence in choice and choice alone to close the achievement gap,” said Amber Arellano, the executive director of the Education Trust Midwest, which advocates higher academic standards.“Instead, we’re replicating failure.” Dawn Wilson’s four oldest children have attended between five and seven schools each — not uncommon in <location>Detroit</location> — moving among charter schools, traditional schools, private religious schools and suburban districts that take <location>Detroit</location> students, and the dollars that follow them.She drives her children 130 miles a week to school — down from 200 last year, now that one daughter lives with another family in a suburb to attend private school.In between, she works as an entertainer for children’s parties.(“Kuddles the Klown,” she answers her cellphone.)“Who else has time to take their kids to all these places to try to find quality education?” she asked.Conflict with a teacher she found disrespectful prompted her to pull her children from one charter.One daughter spent six months at another, but returned to the Christian school she had attended earlier because there were so many fights.Then, at a bus stop for the private school, her daughter was recruited for a charter that promised college seminars and dual enrollment at local colleges — and rewarded her for enrolling with a raffle ticket for a $50 gift card.With all the new schools, <location>Detroit</location> has roughly 30,000 more seats, charter and traditional public, than it needs.The competition to get students to school on count day — the days in October and February when the head count determines how much money the state sends each school — can resemble a political campaign.Schools buy radio ads and billboards, sponsor count day pizza parties and carnivals.They plant rows of lawn signs along <location>New York</location> streets to recruit students, only to have other schools pull those up and stake their own.A few weeks before the February count day two years ago,
