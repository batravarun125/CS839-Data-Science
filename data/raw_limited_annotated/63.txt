In both cases, the airbag inflater can break apart when the bag engages, sending metal parts into the car’s cabin.And in both cases, high temperatures appear to play a role.All seven incidents known to Autoliv had occurred in parked cars in hot weather, Mr. Jonsson said.Echoing language initially used by Takata, Autoliv was still investigating the “root cause” of the defect, he said.At the heart of Takata’s defect is its propellant, the explosive that helps inflate the airbag in a tiny fraction of a second.Takata’s propellant is based on a solid compound called ammonium nitrate, which can break down over time when exposed to moisture or high temperatures.And in its broken-down state, the compound can burn violently, causing the inflater to overpressurize and explode.In one recent incident, a <location>Texas</location> teenager was killed when an inflater fragment severed an artery in her neck.Autoliv does not use ammonium nitrate in its airbags, Mr. Jonsson said.Instead, its side-curtain inflaters use stored compressed gas and a different solid propellant to inflate the airbag.A welding problem in metal tubing made by an Autoliv subcontractor was causing a crack to appear in the inflater, Mr. Jonsson said, and in hot conditions, the gas could overpressurize, causing the inflater to break in two.He said the subcontractor deviated from approved manufacturing processes between 2010 and 2012, resulting in the defect.But that process has since been fixed, he said.Mr. Jonsson disputed Toyota’s description of the defect in its filing with Japanese regulators, which warned that inflater fragments could burst into the car’s cabin.Mr. Jonsson said that in six of the seven incidents, the broken parts of the inflater had stayed put or had simply dropped out; in one case, there was “more movement.” Autoliv supplied the inflater in question to four other automakers.Mr. Jonsson refused to name those automakers, however, saying Autoliv was not aware of any airbag incidents in their cars.Those automakers are not conducting recalls.Autoliv said in a regulatory filing in April that it was investigating six incidents related to its airbags, and possible recall costs of $10 million to $40 million.But the details of its airbag defect had not been known.Toyota on Wednesday issued a second recall in <location>Japan</location>, to fix a possible fault with a mechanism in vehicles’ fuel tanks that releases evaporated fuel.
