But the extent to which Mr. Trump is doing well among white working-class voters is important to Democrats.There are more white working-class voters than is generally believed, and Mr. Obama was stronger among these voters than typically assumed.Mr. Trump’s speech on Tuesday was delivered in <location>Monessen</location>, Pa., the sort of place that typifies the overlooked Democratic resilience among white working-class voters, and that Mr. Trump needs in November.The area was once one of the most reliably Democratic parts of the country, and even today, Democrats still fare fairly well among white working-class voters.President Obama won <location>Monessen</location> by a 66-33 percent margin, and the town is at the tip of a region along the <location>Monongahela</location> river where Mr. Obama won among white working-class voters.There are places like this — traditionally Democratic, white working-class areas where Mr. Obama still showed important strength — across the <location>Northern United States.</location> In <location>Pennsylvania</location> alone, there are similar regions along the <location>Beaver River</location> — north of <location>Pittsburgh</location> — or in the <location>Scranton-Wilkes Barre</location> area in northeast <location>Pennsylvania</location>.There’s <location>Ohio</location> — or a whole strip of towns along lake <location>Erie</location>, from <location>Toledo</location>, of <location>Ohio<location>, back to <location>Erie<location>, Pa.Many of these same areas broke heavily for Mr. Trump in the Republican primary.We will not know until November whether Mr. Trump will attract these traditionally Democratic voters.Even if he does, he might fall far short of winning the presidency, as current polls suggest.His gains among less educated white voters have been neatly canceled by losses among well-educated voters.This could prevent Mr. Trump from winning in states with a large white working class.A recent Marquette University poll showed Mr. Trump winning by seven points among white working-class voters in <location>Wisconsin</location>.Yet Mrs. Clinton was leading by a huge 22-point margin among well-educated white voters, even though four years ago they split almost evenly between parties.The same dynamic could doom Mr. Trump in <location>Pennsylvania</location>.But if you want to know why Mr. Trump is still in striking distance — why Mrs. Clinton is generally well beneath 50 percent, and not faring too much better among registered voters than Mr. Obama was in the fall of 2012 — this is why: Mr. Trump has made big gains among less educated white voters.He has adopted a platform to do it.
