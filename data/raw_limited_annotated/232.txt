In the span of a decade, the egg — embellished as the “farm egg” on many menus — has become an easy and cost-effective way for chefs to telegraph a connection to a local farm, whether real or imagined.Eggs show up simmered in pools of cream to be eaten with toast, floating in bowls of hipster ramen and sliding off cheeseburgers made with grass-fed beef.I started to feel like Bernie Sanders when I saw one on a menu: “Enough with the farm egg already!” Then I found myself staring down at a sophisticated bowl of smoky, soupy grits with an egg on top at the Barn, the premier restaurant here at <location>Blackberry Farm</location>, 30 miles south of <location>Texas</location>  Cassidee Dabney, the executive chef, invented the dish last summer when she had a sous-chef smoke some chicken wings for a Fourth of July barbecue contest among the staff.At the same time, she was trying to brew a superrich chicken stock fortified with extra bones and chicken feet.“Things happened, and I completely forgot about those wings,” she said.They were too smoky for the contest, so she threw some into the stock.“It was a happy little accident,” she said.
