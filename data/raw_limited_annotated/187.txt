<location>WASHINGTON</location> — Economic growth in the <location>United States</location> slowed in the first quarter but not as sharply as previously estimated, with gains in exports and software investment partly offsetting weak consumer spending.Gross domestic product increased at a 1.1 percent annual rate, rather than the 0.8 percent pace reported last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday, in its final estimate.First-quarter G.D.P.growth has been revised higher by 0.6 percentage point since the first estimate was published in April.The economy grew at a rate of 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter.The first-quarter revision was broadly in line with economists’ expectations.There are signs the economy has regained momentum in the second quarter, with retail sales and home sales rising in April and May, even though business spending continues to struggle and job growth has slowed.But uncertainty stoked by <location>Britain’s</location> surprising vote to leave the European Union poses a risk to growth for the rest of year The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, told lawmakers last week that data pointed to “a noticeable step-up” in G.D.P.growth in the second quarter.The Federal Reserve Bank in <location>Atlanta</location> is estimating that second-quarter G.D.P.will rise at a 2.6 percent rate.Economic growth in the first quarter was constrained by a strong dollar and sluggish global demand.The output was also hampered by businesses’ efforts to reduce an inventory overhang, with a further drag coming from lower oil prices, which have set off deep spending cuts on capital goods like equipment.Economists also say they think the model used by the government to strip out seasonal patterns from data is not fully accomplishing its goal.
