<location>PARIS</location> — The bioacoustician and musician Bernie Krause has been recording soundscapes of the natural world since 1968, from coral reefs to elephant stamping grounds to the Amazonian rain forest.Now, Mr. Krause’s recordings have become part of an immersive new exhibition at the Cartier Foundation here called “The Great Animal Orchestra.” Named after Mr. Krause’s 2012 book of the same title, the show opens on Saturday and runs through Jan. 8.At its heart is a work by the <location>London</location>-based collective United Visual Artists, who have transformed Mr. Krause’s recordings of the natural world into 3-D renderings.Imagine stepping into a soundproofed black-box theater whose walls spring to life with what look like overlapping electrocardiograms, representing different species’ sounds.“It’s way cool,” Mr. Krause, 77, said last week, opening his laptop to show the sounds and spectrographs on which United Visual Artists based the sound-and-light installation.Higher-pitched sounds, from animals like bats and insects, appeared at the top of the screen, then below them frogs and other amphibians, and finally lower-pitched mammals toward the bottom, each with a distinctive yawp.The installation includes recordings Mr. Krause made in <location>Ontario</location>, where he found himself caught between two packs of wolves.He also captured the cacophony of the Amazon, and whales off <location>Alaska</location> and <location>Hawaii</location>.“They’re very jazzlike, actually,” he said of the whales.But the animal calls also carry a message.Mr. Krause estimates that of the sounds in his vast archive — more than 5,000 hours of recordings from 2,000 habitats encompassing some 15,000 species — 50 percent come from habitats that no longer exist.“A lot of these habitats in this exhibit are in danger,” he said.In the forest where he recorded in the <location>Africa</location>, “all the elephants are gone now,” he said.“Wolves in <location>North America</location> are always under great stress,” he added.
