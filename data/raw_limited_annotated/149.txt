The State Supreme Court has signed off on a new education funding law that increases state aid to poor school districts.The justices issued a brief order Tuesday saying that the Legislature “has currently satisfied” the court’s orders on education funding by approving the measure last week.The decision ends a threat that public schools would be shut down after Thursday.Gov.Sam Brownback, a Republican, signed the school finance measure into law on Monday.Lawyers for the state and lawyers for four school districts that had sued the state submitted a joint statement saying that the measure complied with the court’s dictates.The justices ruled last month that the funding system remained unfair to poor school districts.(AP) Lawyers for an Air Force officer charged with rape, adultery and other crimes are making the novel argument that the military ban on extramarital sex discriminates against heterosexuals because it does not specifically include same-sex couples.Lawyers for Col. Eugene Caughey of the Air Force challenged the adultery provision Monday in a military court at Peterson Air Force Base.They argued that the half-dozen adultery charges against Colonel Caughey should be thrown out because they violate his constitutional rights.
