“I compare it to — remember that movie ‘Little Buddha’ with Keanu Reeves?” In that film, a clutch of Tibetan monks show up on the doorstep of an ordinary American couple, convinced their young son is a reincarnated lama.Mr. Chabon was wearing a pair of Margiela boots that his son had insisted upon — not Abe, but his brother.“We spent like an hour convincing him,” Abe said.“I wanted him to get YSL boots and my brother was like, ‘No, you need to get these!’ My brother won.” The model Luka Sabbat, another front row attendee, wandered over, and the two exchanged reviews.Both plan to attend more shows in the coming days.Backstage, Mr. Ackermann was slowly processing a line of well-wishers who were lined up in a bottleneck after the show as bad as the one they had been in before it.The collection had been inspired, he said, by the young guys around him, carefree hedonists for whom partying is a calling and a duty.“They dance in the club and they sweat and they enjoy,” Mr. Ackermann said.“I just wanted to have all this happiness, all this embrace of joy.” The blotchy prints that might have been maps or ink blots suddenly came into focus: They were sweat stains, imaginatively transformed.The joy Mr. Ackermann channeled was, he agreed, all the more valuable in uncertain, unhappy days like these.“Very true, very true,” he said.“It’s colorful.It’s so poetic against this melancholic sky.” He paused for a moment.“I would have loved to have it raining,” he said with a glance upward.“Not on you,” he added quickly, looking back at the long line of journalists and guests who had come from the outdoor seating to congratulate him.“Raining on all the guys.”
