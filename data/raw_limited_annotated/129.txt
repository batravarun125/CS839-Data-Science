In 1977, the photographer John Stewart was commissioned by Muhammad Ali to take his portrait.“Two franchisers of Muhammad Ali came to see me,” he recalls.“They had seen a show of my work in <location>New York</location> and had suggested to Ali he should have me photograph him.I was summoned to <location>Chicago</location> to meet ‘the Greatest.’” The late boxer gave Stewart, now 96, worldwide exclusivity of his portrait for one year — rights that Stewart eventually sold to his friend Andy Warhol.Below are Stewart’s images of Ali, which have been shown and sold in galleries in limited edition, and his memory of their time together.On a beautiful spring day in 1977, I ring the door at Ali’s mansion, situated at the edge of a mixed black and white neighborhood.A giant in a white robe and a yellow turban bids me to enter.I pass in front of a throng of men — standing, sitting on the floor or on the stairway, waiting for an audience.After half an hour alone in a vast cream and gold room, lined with armchairs, I am shown the way downstairs.I pass through a tall Chinese portico flanked on one side by a stuffed lion and on the other by a tiger.In the exercise room beyond the portico, dressed in a blue sports outfit, Ali is sitting on a low stool, wiping his face with a towel.I didn’t have to introduce myself.Ali had been told.He didn’t even look up.
