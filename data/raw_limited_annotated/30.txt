A comparable measure of the health of the British banking system has risen only 0.08 percent since Brexit, and actually was down Tuesday.The spread has risen even less in euro-denominated bank lending.That’s good news.It suggests investors think that profits by banks will get hammered by Brexit — but not that this will endanger their very solvency.Banks may be facing huge costs as they weigh whether to relocate operations from <location>London</location> to <location>Europe</location>.Investors will find uncertainty around their businesses and leaner profits as central banks potentially cut interest rates further.But collectively, it appears that investors believe that banks will weather the storm, or at least that governments won’t let them fail.So the mechanisms of financial contagion that turned the collapse of the fourth-largest American investment bank into a global crisis just don’t seem to be gearing up.And that is reflected even in the most widely followed markets.Yes, the British pound is down sharply on currency markets.But the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index is down only 4.5 percent, and is still above its levels from as recently as March.But if financial contagion doesn’t appear to be a grave threat, political contagion does.The modern global economy is built on the notion of a free flow of trade, capital and people among the major advanced nations of <location>Europe</location>, <location>America</location> and <location>Asia</location>.The European Union has been a key vehicle through which that modern order has evolved.<location>Britain’s</location> E.U.exit won’t by itself change that, and even British advocates of leaving the trading bloc say that they want continued good relations, trade and otherwise, with <location>Europe</location>.Things might work out just fine, with perhaps a more inward-focused <location>Britain</location> but no other major changes to this global financial and economic order.But if this is just a first step toward raising much higher walls between the major powers of <location>Europe</location> — if countries like <location>France<location>,<location>Italy</location> and even <location>Germany</location> retreat inward and build distrust that rips at that order?It will make Lehman seem like a historical asterisk.In September 2008, no one predicted that the Lehman bankruptcy could lead to a Greek sovereign debt crisis that would halt half a century of progress toward European unity.The risk with Brexit is, similarly, not in the consequences we know, but in the ones that we don’t know.
