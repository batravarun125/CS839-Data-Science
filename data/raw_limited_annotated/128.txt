Last Friday night, inside an industrial building , guests slumped into white sofas, sipped beers and chatted; some studied the foliage that had been installed in the space with a web of cords.The Berlin-based artist Isabel Lewis took the mic, lowered the volume of the music and thanked the crowd for coming.She named a few of the people she’d already met; then she asked a man who identified himself as “Doug from around the corner” if he thought he had a soul.This seamlessly glided into a group discussion and, later, Kizomba, a type of dance that originated in <location>Angola</location>.In lieu of a formal waitstaff passing hors d’oeuvres, a casually dressed woman holding a platter asked, “Do you want some food?” It was all part of the first segment of Lewis’s Dia commission, “Occasions and Other Occurrences,” which runs on the weekends through mid-July.Lewis introduced “Occasions” at the International Festival in 2013 and has brought them to <location>London</location> and <location>Geneva</location>, among other places; she describes them as experiences that address all five senses.This one begins at the art foundation’s <location>Chelsea</location> location, continues on the M.T.A.Metro-North Railroad with a downloadable mixtape.How did you approach the Dia commission?I was compelled by Dia’s relation to both <location>N.Y.C.</location> and <location>Beacon</location>; I understood early in my process of developing the new occasions that I wanted to bring out the strength and specificity of both of these locations.In the city, there is this density of human interrelations and activities contained by the architecture and the urban plan.In the valley, the quietness and the landscape are just as powerful as the intensity of the city but in a completely different way.How does it all unfold?The Friday evenings in <location>Chelsea</location> focus on our inter-human relations and the intertwining of the organic and the technological.Visitors enter into a decorated space with furniture elements that I’ve designed and that organize bodies in space in a specific way.The five senses are addressed and as the host, I weave together contemporary Angolan music, a partner-dance style called Kizomba and conversation.The train ride sets the mood for the Saturday and Sunday occasions in Beacon.When visitors enter Long Dock Park, they are surrounded by music coming from a sound system that’s integrated into the landscape, and they can relax on the wooden furniture that I’ve created and placed throughout the park.
