The Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers rapidly took to Twitter to blast Mr. Trump’s plans as likely to lead to “higher prices, fewer jobs and a weaker economy,” as the Chamber’s official account put it.There are very real questions about the ways trade deals have sped up a decline in American manufacturing, pumped up trade deficits and pressured wages down across the board.These complaints have been a staple of labor unions and politicians on the left for ages; Hillary Clinton has pledged to renegotiate deals to be more favorable to American workers if elected.That’s what makes it striking that — rather than temper his primary-season language criticizing trade deals — Mr. Trump is, if anything, running to Mrs. Clinton’s left on the subject.He even cited the work of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, in the speech.Notably, these were not off-the-cuff comments, but rather an enumerated platform scripted and read from a teleprompter.But in making the utter rejection of Nafta and normalized trade relations with <location>China</location> central to his campaign, Mr. Trump is evoking a different <location>United States</location>.Since peaking in World War II at 38 percent of all jobs, manufacturing employment has been on a steady downward trajectory almost continuously ever since.Currently 8.5 percent of American jobs are in manufacturing.Anyone younger than 35 has never lived in a world where more than one in five jobs were in factories.Some of that is surely because of more open trade with places where wages are lower.But it is also because of remarkable advances in technology that mean a huge, gleaming factory making airplane parts or industrial fasteners might need only a dozen workers to keep it running rather than a hundred.America’s economy has kept growing because factory output has risen even as manufacturing employment has fallen.As Mr. Trump faces a general election, the question is how much his message of economic nostalgia will resonate, particularly beyond the older Americans who mourn a lost age.In other words, it’s easy to see why the people who used to work in those 5,100 no-longer-existent steel jobs in the <location>Pittsburgh</location> area might vote for Mr. Trump.But how will he fare with those additional 66,000 health care workers?The answer may well determine the election, and the course of the United States’s economic relationship with the rest of the world.
