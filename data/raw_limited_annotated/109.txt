We know the provision by nondescript names: Early entry.One and done.I call it the Spencer Haywood rule.The 29 underclassmen who walked across the stage during the N.B.A.draft last week at Barclays Center and shook hands with Commissioner Adam Silver should have also shaken hands with Haywood and said, “Thank you.” From Kobe Bryant to LeBron James, every player who has gone from high school to the pros, or who has left college before completing a four-year tour of duty, owes a debt of gratitude to Haywood.At 20, he took on the N.B.A.and forced open the doors for generations of young players, including Ben Simmons and Brandon Ingram, the top two overall picks this year.Haywood’s 1971 lawsuit, Haywood v. National Basketball Association, invalidated N.B.A.rules that said a player was ineligible for the draft until four years after his high school graduation, or the graduation of his class in the case of a dropout.Haywood challenged the cozy arrangement between the N.C.A.A.and the N.B.A.that essentially compelled athletes to play four years in college.It was an arrangement that benefited colleges and the N.B.A., but not necessarily the players.I visited with Haywood over the last few days.He was in <location>Brooklyn</location> for the draft, and the National Basketball Players Association this week screened the powerful new documentary about his life, “Full Court.” Haywood, 67, said he had never attended the draft before.“I’m walking through the hallways looking at players,” he said.“Their agents are saying, ‘That’s that old Spencer Haywood guy.’ They say ‘early entry,’ but they really don’t know what they’re talking about.” Haywood is pushing for the union to make “the Spencer Haywood rule” the official name of the provision that allows underclassmen into the N.B.A.“It would make a world of difference to all of the players because they’ll know that there’s a person who made that sacrifice,” he said.“They have got to know that somebody did this.You can’t leave it out in space.” The problem with continuing to refer to this game-changing provision as “early entry” or “one and done” is that those labels fail to assign ownership to the rule and leave questions unanswered: How did it begin?Who pushed for it?Was it always like this?Was it easy to accomplish?“Early entry” implies easy entry, that the right for young players to enter the league without waiting four years was bequeathed by the N.B.A.out of a sense of benevolence.In fact, the N.B.A.fought Haywood tooth and nail, as if the league’s survival depended on it.Caretakers of the league felt it did.The N.B.A.argued that the influx of young players would destroy the league, that the siphoning of talent from college basketball teams would destroy college basketball and would ruin the N.B.A.’s pool of talent.The documentary illustrates the extent to which the N.B.A.used its muscle to keep Haywood off the court, and even out of arenas, as it fought him and the SuperSonics owner Sam Schulman, who broke ranks in March 1970 when he signed Haywood.The commissioner of the N.B.A.
