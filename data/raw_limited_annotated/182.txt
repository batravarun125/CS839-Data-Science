“Juliet?” said the voice on the other end of the line, in an unmistakable <location>Tennessee</location> accent.“This is Coach Pat Summitt.” I nearly dropped the phone.Back then, in January 1997, I was a journalism school student, and I had called Summitt’s office at the University of <location>Tennessee</location> to request an interview.It was one of a dozen calls I made to top college coaches for my master’s project, which focused on the American Basketball League, a new women’s professional league.The only coach to return my call was Pat Summitt.Summitt wasn’t just any coach: She and her Lady Vols had just won their fourth national championship and were on their way to winning a fifth.We spoke for more than an hour.When I thanked her for calling, she said that she always had time for young women trying to make their way in sports.Summitt died Tuesday at 64 after years of struggling with Alzheimer’s-type dementia.In her 38 years as a head college coach, she won 1,098 games, more than any other Division I coach, man or woman, and led <location>Tennessee</location> to eight national championships.You can talk about her toughness: She once dislocated her shoulder while chasing an aggressive raccoon off her porch, in an attempt to protect her Labrador retriever, and spent two hours trying to pop her shoulder back into place before calling for medical help.And you can talk about what a leader she was, for her players and for women’s sports.When she was offered a job coaching the men at <location>Tennessee</location>, she said, “Why is that considered a step up?” But it’s also important to remember how Summitt dealt with dementia, and what a perfect reflection it was of her personality.Like Muhammad Ali, in his long fight with Parkinson’s disease, Summitt faced a progressive malady for which there is no known cure — a disease that works to steal a person’s dignity and tempts those with it to retreat from the public eye.Everyone chooses to deal with those diseases in a different way, no one effort more courageous than another.Summitt and Ali’s way was to use their fame and bring the world along on their journey, as they became the public faces of diseases that were once taboo to even acknowledge.Their efforts to shed light on their vulnerabilities just added to their legacies, but in a totally different — and, arguably, more important — way.When Summitt learned she had dementia, in 2011, she was only 59.“There’s not going to be any pity party, and I’ll make sure of that,” she told The Knoxville News Sentinel.She told ABC, “What I want to do is to get people to understand that if you have dementia, don’t be afraid of it.” If you know anything about dementia or Parkinson’s, you know that in fact, there is plenty to be afraid of.Dementia slowly robs you of your cognitive abilities, eats away at your brain.Parkinson’s is another cruel thief: It steals facial expressions, voices, movement, the ability to swallow and, eventually, to breathe.It can also cause dementia.
