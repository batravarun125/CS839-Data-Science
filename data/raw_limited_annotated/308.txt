In the most dramatic confrontation over the two years of the investigation, Mrs. Clinton testified before the committee for more than eight hours in October.The hearing was widely perceived to have backfired on Republicans, as she answered their questions and coolly deflected their attacks.By the time of her testimony, Mrs. Clinton had already taken responsibility for the State Department’s handling of the attacks.Previous investigations concluded that State Department officials had erred in not better securing the diplomatic compound amid reports of a deteriorating security situation.But they also determined that the attacks had come with little warning and that it would have been difficult to intervene once they had begun.The investigations generally concluded that after the attack, the Obama administration’s talking points were flawed but not deliberately misleading.The Pentagon had no forces that could be readily sent to <location>Benghazi</location> when the crisis began.The closest AC-130 gunship was in <location>Afghanistan</location>.There were no armed drones within range of <location>Libya</location>.There was no Marine expeditionary unit, a large seaborne force with its own helicopters, in the <location>Mediterranean</location>  The African Command also did not have on hand a force able to respond rapidly to emergencies.Every other regional command had one at the time.The Pentagon was caught unprepared for this type of crisis.On the night of the attacks, the Pentagon was able to divert an unarmed Predator drone operating 90 miles away to <location>Benghazi</location>, and the C.I.A.later used it to help plan an escape route for the surviving Americans.But other military forces were too far away or could not be mobilized in time, military commanders have said.The unclassified version of an independent 2012 report, headed by Thomas R. Pickering, a former diplomat, concluded that “there simply was not enough time, given the speed of the attacks, for armed <location>U.S.</location> military assets to have made a difference.” But that report did not address whether it would have been prudent to station quick-reaction forces in the region, a step the Pentagon has since taken.At a news conference at the <location>Capitol<location> square on Tuesday, Mr. Gowdy praised as heroes the Americans who died in the attacks on Sept. 11, 2012.They included Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and Sean Smith, a State Department information officer, who were killed at the main American diplomatic compound in <location>Benghazi</location> by a mob of militia fighters who had been incited by an American-made video deriding the Prophet Muhammad.The fighters were apparently further inflamed by news of an assault on the American Embassy in <location>Cairo</location>.Two other Americans, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty, who were contractors for the C.I.A., died later when a separate annex run by the agency was hit by mortars.The attacks spanned about eight hours.At the time the select committee was created, there had been at least seven congressional inquiries into the <location>Benghazi</location> attacks in addition to the State Department’s review, with all of them reaching much the same conclusion.Mr. Gowdy urged Americans to read all 800 pages of the report.“You can read this report from pillar to post in less time than our fellow Americans were under attack in <location>Benghazi</location>,” he said.
