So instead of seeing where a stock, bond or more complicated item is trading now, or even a few weeks ago, and then using this information to determine how much the investment is worth, valuing a Level 3 asset requires risk managers to, quite literally, make a guess.The process has come to be known on trading desks as “mark to myth” as opposed to the official vernacular of mark to model.According to their 2015 annual reports, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are sitting on the largest piles of Level 3 assets: 36 billion pounds for Barclays, 32 billion euros for Deutsche Bank and 31.5 billion Swiss francs for Credit Suisse.In June 2013, financial analysts at Berenberg, a German bank, highlighted the Level 3 exposures at these three banks in particular in warning of their investment prospects.At Credit Suisse, for example, Berenberg said that Level 3 assets were 133 percent of the firm’s core capital cushion.The percentage for Deutsche Bank was 96 percent and for Barclays, 49 percent.The bank’s advice to investors?Sell.Since then, Deutsche Bank’s shares have fallen by 64 percent, Credit Suisse’s by 65 percent and Barclays’ by 53 percent.Reflecting concerns among investors with regard to the risky assets they own, the three banks trade at steep discounts to their book value; Deutsche Bank leads the way at 70 percent.And there are few signs that the selling will let up soon, as a growing number of hedge funds have increased their bets against European banks.George Soros, who became known as the man who broke the bank in <location>England</location> with a bet against the British pound in 1992, made a multimillion-dollar wager against Deutsche Bank after the British vote to leave the European Union.His Soros Fund Management took a short position of 0.51 percent of the bank’s stock on Friday, when the referendum results were announced.Marshall Wace, a <location>London</location>-based hedge fund, took a similar position that day.Both moves were disclosed in regulatory filings in <location>Germany</location>, where investors are required to disclose their short positions once they hit a threshold.This month, Mr. Thiam sent an email to employees attributing Credit Suisse’s low stock price to short positions taken by hedge funds.In a similar vein, a team of German academics published a study last year in which they concluded that the higher a bank’s exposure to these types of assets, the greater the chances that it might default at some point.In an interview on Tuesday, one of the paper’s three authors, Jan Riepe, a finance professor at the University of Tübingen, argued that the uncertainty surrounding <location>Britain’s</location> future in <location>Europe</location> made these banks an even riskier bet, as it will be all the harder to get rid of these securities in such an environment.“All this Brexit uncertainty is drying up the markets,” Mr. Riepe said.“And because many of these assets are traded over the counter in <location>London</location>, it is even more difficult to value them.It’s very dangerous for the banks.”
