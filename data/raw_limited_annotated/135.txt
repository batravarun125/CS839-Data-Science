<location>WASHINGTON</location> — Despite the inconsistencies of his season, the Mets needed Matt Harvey to be his old self Tuesday against their division rival Nationals.The Mets had lost two straight games.The starting rotation, the backbone of the team, was dinged up like other parts of the team.Then the rain came.While an improved Harvey was facing Danny Espinosa in the bottom of the fourth inning of a one-run game, umpires sent both teams into their clubhouses because of a heavy thunderstorm.Once the hour-and-25-minute delay was over, the Mets were forced to cobble together the rest of the game with the bullpen, which stumbled in a 5-0 loss.“I’m sure he’ll say it: This is the best he’s felt all year,” Manager Terry Collins said of Harvey.“That’s why it’s a really tough night not to be able to stay out there and pitch a little bit.” Previously stellar this season, Jerry Blevins allowed a two-run home run to Bryce Harper in the fifth inning.Blevins mistakenly fired a fastball over the middle of the strike zone, and Harper smashed it into the home bullpen in right field.It was the first home run that Blevins had surrendered to a left-handed batter since 2013, and it gave the Nationals a 3-0 lead.The game started an hour late because of rain.After the delay in the fourth, the Mets finished the game piecemeal, with four relievers.That wasn’t Harvey’s fault; the weather simply had other plans.The game also started an hour late because of rain.Harvey’s season has been a battle to find steadiness.He has said after starts that his mechanics have not been right, and then thinking about them during games hasn’t helped either.Harvey looked better at times on Tuesday, his slider sharper than before.He allowed one run on four hits and walked three batters in three and two-thirds innings, but he looked more comfortable.“Anytime is a good time,” Harvey said.“Obviously didn’t want to keep going the way I was.But it’s nice to be a little better.” Because of the long delay in the fourth inning, Harvey could not return to the mound.
