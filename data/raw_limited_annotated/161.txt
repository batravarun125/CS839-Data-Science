Even before <location>Britain</location> voted to cut ties with the rest of <location>Europe</location>, large <location>European</location> banks with global ambitions and sprawling operations in <location>London</location> were struggling.Now, as banks scramble to assess the impact of a British exit from the European Union, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Barclays and others face increased pressure from investors.While they recovered some ground on Tuesday, the stock prices of these banks have fallen sharply after the British vote, on increased fears that they will be unable to sell the billions of dollars of derivatives, securitized mortgages and other hard-to-value and sell securities that they so desperately need to get rid of.Mike Mayo, a banking analyst with CLSA, refers to what he calls the 5 C’s in describing what ails the big European banks — a number of which he has worked for during his peripatetic career.These are costs, complexity, capital markets, currency risks and central banks, which engineered the superlow interest rates that are squeezing margins.“The pain is not going away anytime soon,” he said.Britain’s decision, however, also raises more existential questions about the futures of these entities, which over the decades became rooted in the notion that <location>London</location> was — and would always be — the financial locus of <location>Europe</location>.While it is not expected that European banks will immediately resettle their <location>London</location>-based bankers and traders in <location>Zurich</location>, <location>Hong Kong</location>, <location>Frankfurt</location> or <location>New York</location>, the vote — and its political consequences — certainly challenges the view that <location>London</location> will continue to be the spiritual and financial hub of these institutions.It was precisely this mind-set that led Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Credit Suisse to hire many thousands of investment bankers and traders to staff fast-growing <location>London</location> offices in the 20 years leading up to the financial crisis.The wisdom at the time was that destinies were being driven by high-risk, high-return trading businesses tapping into a global finance boom centered largely in <location>London</location>.During the heyday, in fact, all three banks were led by executives who rose through the ranks on the strength of their expertise in peddling bonds and derivatives to global investors.Anshu Jain of Deutsche Bank and Robert E. Diamond at Barclays were based in <location>London</location>, while Brady Dougan at Credit Suisse made constant trips to the firm’s office there from <location>New York</location> and <location>Zurich</location>.As regulators forced banks worldwide to cut back on risky businesses in recent years, worried boardrooms unceremoniously replaced the old guard with new leaders who were ordered to exit chancy areas that consumed the cash needed to fund new strategies in areas like wealth management.By any measure, it has not been an easy job.In a global financial environment that is both risk-averse and lacking enough ready buyers and sellers, offloading billions of dollars of mortgage securities, interest rate derivatives and leveraged loans has been a herculean task.Making the job harder is that the traders and investment bankers at these large banks are highly compensated, have big egos and are generally resistant to change.The new head at Credit Suisse, Tidjane Thiam, has had more of a problem in this regard than his peers.The result has been a bank more or less in open revolt.Perhaps the best way to assess a bank’s broad risk profile is to look at its exposure to Level 3 securities, which it is required to disclose regularly.Level 3 assets are securities that because they are so opaque and complex trade very rarely, if at all.
