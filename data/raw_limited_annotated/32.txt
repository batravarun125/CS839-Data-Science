“We have no job opportunities in <location>Nepal</location>,” Mr. Tamang said, adding that he had paid a broker the equivalent of about $3,300 to get to <location>Kabul</location>, where he was paid $950 a month — a fraction of the salaries paid to Western security contractors.Some of the Nepalese guards hoped to build a house.Others, like Mr. Tamang, were trying to rebuild their lives after <location>Nepal’s</location> devastating earthquake last year.One of the security guards killed in the <location>Kabul</location> attack had lost a son and a daughter in the earthquake, according to Nepalese media reports.The family of Lil Bahadur Gurung, another victim of the bombing, had been forced to live in a makeshift shelter after their home was destroyed, and was waiting for Mr. Gurung to send money home so they could rebuild, according to his daughter, Anita Gurung.“Our family lost our breadwinner,” she said.Beyond need, there is also the allure of tradition for some who go abroad.Nepalese Gurkhas, renowned for their fearlessness, have served in the British Army since the 19th century.In today’s war zones, the willingness of the Gurkhas to serve long hours in the most dangerous posts is a source of pride for the soldiers, and it has kept them in high demand.But the reality of security jobs is often different from the dream.In <location>Kabul</location>, the contractors had lived together in the fortified compound behind a gas station on <location>Jalalabad</location> street.And they were all but sequestered when they were not at work in the embassy, spending their time playing volleyball or skyping their families, according to Mr. Tamang.The Nepalese guards had separate facilities from the 25 or so Western contractors who also lived at the camp, as well as separate rules.The Nepalese guards were not allowed to leave the compound, relying on local Afghan guards to fetch essentials from a nearby store.And they were not allowed to drink alcohol in their leisure time.Three days after the attack, the Nepalese government announced that it would restrict the travel of its citizens to <location>Afghanistan</location> and facilitate trips for those who wanted to return.But the regulations are seen as easy to circumvent, and conditions in <location>Nepal</location> are only becoming more desperate, said Laxman Basnet, the <location>Nepal</location>-based general secretary of the South Asian Regional Trade Union Council.The attack might deter people for a few weeks, and give others second thoughts, but “there are no job opportunities in <location>Nepal</location>,” he said.With thousands of Nepalis working abroad, the latest deaths have added to a grim procession of bodies returning to <location>Nepal</location>, several at a time, every day, Mr. Basnet said.People have become inured to deaths, from violence or after years of toiling abroad.“It has sunk into our psyche,” he said.It was only by luck that the toll from the bombing last week was not higher, judging from the shrapnel that had torn the metal surrounding shops nearby.The bomber struck early, as the Nepalese guards headed out at 6 a.m. to relieve their colleagues on the night shift at the embassy.Mr. Tamang said he had been on duty that morning, waiting for the men on the bus to relieve him.Hours later, after telling the guards about the attack, Canadian officials sent the men home in an armored vehicle.
