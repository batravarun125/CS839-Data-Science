<location>China</location> — After shouldering loads up and down steep hills here for 35 years, Niu Dancheng knows the exact number of stairs to <location>Yangtze River</location> docks where he often finds work as a porter.There are 128 to Dock 8 at <location>Chaotianmen port</location>, he said, which he had just descended with 90 pounds of roasted duck for a cruise ship.Mr. Niu, 62, may belong to the last generation of itinerant porters, known as “bang bang,” who have become a symbol of <location>Chongqing</location>, a city that clings to the towering hills where the <location>Jialing River</location> flows into the mighty <location>Yangtze</location> in southwest <location>China</location>.The streets here once teemed with a “bang-bang army,” as residents call the porters.Now they are disappearing.“The next generation will never carry one of these,” Mr. Niu said, tapping his sturdy bamboo shoulder pole or bangzi, whose name inspired the popular nickname for the porters.“Our work is vanishing.” The decline of the porters is, in miniature, the story of social and population shifts reshaping <location>China’s</location> economy.The economy is slowing, but the flow of rural migrants seeking work in cities is also slowing, and those migrants are aging.Younger, better educated migrants often reject such poorly paid, harsh work, and modern transportation has cut demand for the backbreaking job of hauling loads up and down <location>Chongqing’s</location> hills.These changes have left the “bang-bang army” shrinking, aging and struggling economically.“It’s tough being a bang-bang now,” said Hu Zuhua, 50, who has worked as a porter for a decade.“Sometimes you don’t even make enough to pay for meals.The couriers are taking all our business.” He Changlin, a filmmaker who recorded the world of the porters in a documentary and book called “The Last Bang bang,” estimated that their numbers have shrunk from as many as 300,000 in the 1990s to no more than 10,000 in urban.Most are in their 50s or older.“This is a business that is destined to disappear and it won’t be long before it does,” Mr.He said.“It’s a business steadily being made obsolete by a combination of economic development and the laws of nature.As the Chinese economy rapidly develops and forms of transportation diversify, they no longer have a role to play.” For decades, residents never had to go far to find porters, who for a dollar or two heaved food, clothes and other loads from door to door.“There were so many bang-bang, they’d worry that we’d fall into the river and drown,” Mr. Niu said, drawing on a cigarette as he rested between jobs.“They don’t have to worry about that now.” <location>Chongqing</location>, a sprawling, industrial metropolis, grew from trade up and down the <location>Yangtze</location> river, and long relied on brute human strength to haul loads.But demand for the porters took off in the 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping’s market reforms gave urban Chinese residents more spending power and let farmers enter cities to find work, unleashing a wave of migrants desperate for jobs at a time when the working-age population was bulging.Villagers from the steep hill country around <location>Chongqing</location> found a living using their stamina to carry loads in the city, and the streets and docks teemed with men in faded blue coats and canvas shoes clutching poles and bundles of rope.Porters popped up in many cities, but it was only in <location>Chongqing</location> and other nearby towns that they grew so numerous that they became part of the fabric of daily life.At their peak, they became a symbol of the city, celebrated as humble, salt-of-the-earth workers in songs and even in a popular television comedy-drama in 1997.“You’re tremendous,” Premier Li said when he met a group of porters in <location>Chongqing</location> in 2014.
