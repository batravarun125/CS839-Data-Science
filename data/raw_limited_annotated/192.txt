For many New Yorkers, the mango dessert being served this summer at Indian Accent, the chef Manish Mehrotra’s restaurant in <location>Midtown</location>, is likely to come as a revelation.Think of it as a study in mango, a series of poetic variations that pay tribute to the fruit’s versatility.To put it together, Mr. Mehrotra and his team arrange slices of ripe orange fruit in a bowl.The chef is using prime Kesar mangoes, meltingly sweet and soft.The slices rise like a ridged island out of a saffron-hued puddle of mango purée.They’re surrounded by tiny boats of contrasting texture: air-dried light-as-meringue puffs and gummy cubes.Astride the mango atoll stands a creamy scoop of shrikhand, a thick strained yogurt mixed with sugar, almond powder and a pinch of cardamom.
