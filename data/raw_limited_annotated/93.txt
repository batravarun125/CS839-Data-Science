“My stroke didn’t feel that good,” Phelps said.“Honestly, I didn’t feel that good in the whole race.” He felt better than many of his national team members.Missy Franklin and Matt Grevers, the reigning Olympic gold medalists in the women’s and men’s 100-meter backstrokes, both failed to make the team in those events.The average age of the four winners Tuesday – Townley Haas in the men’s 200 freestyle, Olivia Smoliga in the women’s 100 backstroke, Ryan Murphy in the men’s 100 backstroke and Lilly King in the women’s 100 breaststroke — was 19.8.“I was like, ‘I see a lot of new faces on this team,’” Phelps said.He added: “I think it’s interesting and also exciting just to have new faces, people who are really pumped to come up in the sport.I think that’s something that for me is a good thing to see as I’m on my way out.”
