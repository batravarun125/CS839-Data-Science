In <location>Paris</location>, a growing appetite for Italian food has encouraged chefs to offer pizzas and pastas at reasonable prices — in handsome settings.It comes as little surprise that Daroco, the new design-forward Italian eatery in what was once Jean-Paul Gaultier’s first store, attracted a star-studded crowd in its opening week.With much of the space’s original footprint left untouched (the same hulking door, exposed brick and stone, and expansive windows), it was transformed into a chic trattoria with mirrored ceilings, sleek velour banquettes and an open kitchen.From the mezzanine, diners can watch the servers in their <location>Breton</location> stripes (some in tops designed by Le Slip Français, some in saint James, both a nod to Monsieur Gaultier) maneuver the dining room below, carrying well-dressed plates of antipasti and pizza.And past the tables at the back, at the end of a dark corridor, craft cocktails designed by the French mixologist Nico de Soto, co-owner of <location>New York</location> city's Mace bar, are available at the 45-seat corner bar.6 rue Vivienne, 75002, 011-33-1-42-21-93-71.The Roman chef Giovanni Passerini cultivated a following at the helm of the beloved gastronomic restaurant Rino in the 12th Arrondissement.Since it closed in March 2014, his fans have anxiously awaited his next move until earlier this year, when he opened a fresh pasta boutique.And in May, he debuted a namesake restaurant next door, eschewing the ubiquitous fixed menu format in favor of casual à la-carte plates made with humble Italian staples.The sishes include white asparagus with sage and parmesan; fava bean ravioli with fresh peas and pecorino; and fish served whole for sharing.65 rue Traversière, 75012, passerini.paris.
