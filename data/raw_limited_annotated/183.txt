Bank stress exams may test investor patience.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is scheduled to report how 33 financial institutions fared in a simulated bad economic downturn.Countercyclical factors included this year could mean that even those banks that ace the tests will have to hang on to additional profit rather than return more money to shareholders.The Federal Reserve has emphasized the improving resilience of the financial sector.In the first round of results released last week, all banks proved tough enough from a capital perspective to keep lending despite a situation in which gross domestic product fell 7.5 percent.Thatâ€™s because banks have added more than $700 billion of common equity cushioning since 2009.As lenders have become better at passing the exams, their payouts have improved.In 2015, for example, every American bank was cleared to declare a dividend.After failing twice, Citigroup last year was able to increase its own to 5 cents a share from a penny.The national economy is also healthier.Unemployment has halved since May 2009, when the first exam results were released.Then, the jobless figure was 9.4 percent.
