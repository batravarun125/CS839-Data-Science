The book will explore the nine Norse worlds, which are populated by elves, fire demons, the Vanir gods, humans, dwarves, giants and the dead.There are ice giants and elves, familiar deities like Thor, Odin (the wise and occasionally vengeful highest god) and Loki (the giant trickster), and a frightening doomsday scenario, Ragnarok, where the gods fight a fire giant with a flaming sword in an apocalyptic, world-ending battle.Mr. Gaiman has often drawn on the Norse myths in his own fantasy writing.His hallucinatory fantasy novel “American Gods” features a character based on Odin.In his children’s book “Odd and the Frost Giants,” a young boy encounters a fox, an eagle and a bear who turn out to be Loki, Odin and Thor.“Those Norse tales have accompanied me through pretty much everything I’ve done,” he said.“They ran like a vein of silver through Sandman, they were the bedrock of American Gods.
