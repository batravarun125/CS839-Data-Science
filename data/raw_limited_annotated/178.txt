<location>PARIS</location> — Among the many populist movements in <location>Europe</location> encouraged by <location>Britain’s</location> vote to leave the European Union, none was more energized than <location>France’s</location> far-right National Front, whose leader, Marine Le Pen, exulted soon after the results were announced that it was “a day of joy.” For nearly 30 years, the National Front has been vilifying the European Union while striking the same anti-immigration themes that animated the campaign in <location>Britain</location>.Now, with <location>Britain</location> having demonstrated the breadth and depth of opposition to the concentration of powers in <location>Brussels</location> and <location>Europe’s</location> open-borders policy, Ms.Le Pen is seizing the opportunity to build support for herself and her party heading into next year’s presidential election.“This gives us additional legitimacy to carry forward this same debate in <location>France</location>,” she told journalists on Friday, calling for a “Frexit” referendum.The far-right party took particular heart that support for cutting ties with the European Union came from places and voters in <location>Britain</location> that are very similar to the National Front’s base of support in <location>France</location>: working people who see themselves as losers from globalization; rural areas; and small and medium-size cities that feel left behind.With President François Hollande of the governing Socialist Party lagging badly in the polls and the main center-right party wounded by internal problems, Ms.Le Pen is widely expected to do well enough in the initial round of presidential voting next spring to make it to the final round against a candidate from one of the mainstream parties.Actually winning the presidency remains a more remote prospect.But the issues raised by the British vote — sovereignty, national identity, immigration and a popular backlash against what is perceived as an out-of-touch elite — provide Ms.Le Pen with a powerful platform.In an Op-Ed on Tuesday, Ms.Le Pen wrote that the British vote was about one fundamental question: “Do we want an undemocratic authority ruling our lives, or would we rather regain control over our destiny?” The idea of a referendum in <location>France</location> on membership in the European Union was curtly dismissed by Mr. Hollande in a meeting with Ms.Le Pen at the Élysée Palace on Saturday.The National Front is not backing down, though.Ms.Le Pen’s niece, Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, a rising star in the party, said in a television interview on Monday that the so-called Brexit vote would inaugurate “a <location>Europe</location> where one doesn’t give up one’s sovereignty as a nation, for the benefit of stateless bureaucrats in <location>Brussels</location>.” For all the differences between <location>France</location>, a founding member of the bloc and a consistent force in seeking greater unity on the Continent, and <location>Britain</location>, which joined late and rejected membership in initiatives like the common European currency, there are enough similarities in their economies and electorates to give hope to the National Front for a breakthrough.There are the gleaming stores and corporate headquarters in <location>Paris</location>, and wealth-creating, successful cities like <location>Toulouse</location> and <location>Lyon</location>.But then there is the <location>France</location> of abandoned villages and small towns, from which the last baker and butcher have fled, and the <location>France</location> of medium-size cities whose empty storefronts line main streets — what the newspaper Le Monde on Monday called “Ashfield-sur-Garonne” and “Thurrock-sur-Loire.” “In <location>France</location>, you’ve got to recognize the gulf between dynamic metropolises and a rural area that feels looked down on and abandoned,” Alain Juppé, a former prime minister and likely presidential candidate for the center-right Republicans, said in <location>Le Monde</location> on Monday.Sixty percent of the population lives in <location>France</location> as the French geographer and sociologist Christophe Guilluy calls it, — “those who are no longer useful to the economy, who live in the rural areas and the small towns,” he said in an interview.
