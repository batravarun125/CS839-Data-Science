<location>SAN FRANCISCO</location> — Airbnb has charmed and strong-armed lawmakers around the world to allow it to operate in their communities.But two cities, Airbnb’s hometown, <location>San Francisco</location>, and <location>New York</location>, the service’s largest <location>United States</location> market, have not been so compliant.On Monday, Airbnb sued <location>San Francisco</location> over a unanimous decision on June 7 by the city’s Board of Supervisors to fine the company $1,000 a day for every unregistered host on its service.If Airbnb does not comply, it could face misdemeanor charges.The suit follows a bipartisan move by <location>New York</location> lawmakers who voted this month to heavily fine anyone who uses Airbnb to rent a whole apartment for fewer than 30 days, a practice that has been illegal in the state since 2010.The actions show how Airbnb, despite aggressive lobbying efforts, has not been able to persuade some local legislators to play ball.And in the case of <location>New York</location>, the company has demonstrated a surprisingly tin ear for local politics.“We’re not afraid of money in <location>New York</location>,” said Micah Lasher, a state Senate candidate and Airbnb critic, who worked for Eric T. Schneiderman, <location>New York’s</location> attorney general.“There are more competing interests in<location>New York</location> city and it’s harder to push people around.It’s harder to disrupt.” A showdown in the two cities could push thousands of illegal listings off Airbnb — a rare speed bump for a company that has shown few signs of slowing down.Airbnb is in talks for a new round of investment that would peg the company’s worth at about $30 billion, tripling its value in two years.“Airbnb is in a real bind,” said Bradley Tusk, the campaign manager for Michael R. Bloomberg’s 2009 mayoral campaign who has helped start-ups like Uber navigate <location>New York’s</location> political landscape.“It must choose between making their markets dramatically less valuable and getting rid of a cloud of regulatory uncertainty.” Airbnb executives once promoted <location>San Francisco</location> as a city it could work with.After affordable housing advocates expressed fear that the service worsened the city’s housing crunch, Airbnb agreed to cap short-term rentals for entire homes and required hosts of such listings to register with the city.That law, which became known as the “Airbnb law” for its friendliness to the company, took effect in February 2015.But only 20 percent of the 7,000 or so hosts required to register have done so, and Airbnb has not removed lawbreakers, according to David Campos, a member of the Board of Supervisors and a longtime opponent of Airbnb.The board hopes that fines will push Airbnb to help enforce the law it helped create.“Airbnb is proving that it wants to play by its own rules, that it believes that it is entitled to something no business has, absolute freedom to operate free of responsibility and oversight,” Mr. Campos said.“It’s their way or the highway.” In its lawsuit, Airbnb claims that the board has violated the Communications Decency Act, a federal law that prohibits the government from holding websites accountable for the content that is published by their users.Just as a website may not be held liable for comments posted in its chat rooms, the argument goes, Airbnb may not be held accountable for illegal rental listings.In <location>New York</location>, which has an unusually broad anti-Airbnb coalition of Democrats and Republicans, landlords and tenants, affordable housing advocates, real estate developers and unions, the fight has been a long time coming.And it has escalated as other tech start-ups reconciled with local power brokers.The state Senate has voted to legalize fantasy sports, paving the way for the companies DraftKings and FanDuel to operate.<location>New York </location> is now Airbnb’s largest <location>United States</location> market.Hosts in <location>New York</location> generated about $1 billion in revenue last year (Airbnb takes a cut of that), but 55 percent of the <location>New York</location> listings were illegal, according to a study commissioned by affordable housing advocates.
