In today’s on-your-own economy, workers are urged to be entrepreneurial job hoppers, constantly adapting and searching for the next opportunity.But an estimated 30 million Americans — nearly one fifth of the nation’s work force — are hobbled by so-called noncompete agreements, fine print in their employment contracts that keeps them from working for corporate rivals in their next job.Now a number of states are looking to untangle workers from these agreements.The Massachusetts House of Representatives is scheduled to vote this week on a noncompete reform bill.The state is also the location of a union organizing campaign on the noncompete practices of the EMC Corporation, a large technology company based in <location>Hopkinton<location>, <location>Massachusetts>/location> that is known for its aggressive application of these employment contracts.Other states are also taking steps as noncompete agreements have spread to summer interns and sandwich shop employees.<location>Hawaii</location> banned noncompete agreements for technology jobs last year, while <location>New Mexico</location> passed a law prohibiting noncompetes for health care workers.And <location>Oregon</location> and <location>Utah</location> have limited the duration of noncompete arrangements.At the federal level, the White House published a report on noncompete contracts in May that concluded “noncompetes can impose substantial costs on workers, consumers and the economy more generally.” The Treasury Department also issued a report this year criticizing the excessive use of the contracts.The issue hits <location>Massachusetts</location> with particular force because of its technology heritage and failure to keep up with <location>Silicon Valley</location>.In the early 1980s, the Route 128 corridor outside <location>Boston</location>, birthplace of the minicomputer industry and long-gone tech giants like the Digital Equipment Corporation, was seen as the <location>Silicon Valley</location> .Noncompete pacts were only one ingredient in the recipe that worked against <location>Massachusetts</location> and to the advantage of <location>Silicon Valley</location>, where employees can depart and start their own companies mostly without fear of a lawsuit.But they mattered.In <location>California</location>, companies are generally prohibited from enforcing noncompete agreements because of a worker-friendly statute from the 19th century.“It’s hurt our economy in the past, and it’s a statement of values about entrepreneurship and mobility that <location>Massachusetts</location> has noncompetes and <location>California</location> does not,” said Stephen Kraus, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners and president of the New England Venture Capital Association.Noncompete arrangements, proponents say, can protect valuable trade secrets and motivate employers to invest in worker training because employees are less likely to leave.But recent research underlines the effects of noncompete agreements on engineers and scientists in technology businesses, where more than one-third of the employees are covered by them.Technical workers in <location>Massachusetts</location> would be paid about 7 percent more if the state’s noncompete practices mirrored California’s, said Evan Starr.Job mobility is reduced, according to other research, and workers are more likely to detour from their original career paths.
