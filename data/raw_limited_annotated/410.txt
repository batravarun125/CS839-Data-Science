“I have been campaigning for years to lose my job,” Stuart Agnew, a UKIP member of Parliament, said of his position in <location>Brussels</location>.Confronted with the biggest crisis to hit <location>Europe’s</location> six-decade push for greater integration, the European Commission has sought to present a face of implacable calm, despite anguish over Brexit among its officials.Asked on Monday at a news briefing what conclusions the commission might draw from the British vote, its chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, said that this was a matter for <location>Britain</location>.“The commission didn’t call the referendum,” he said.“The ones who did are the ones who have to draw conclusions.” Behind the scenes, most Britons working in the commission and other European institutions in <location>Brussels</location> are in a state of barely disguised despair.Catherine Bearder, a British member of the European Parliament for the Liberal Democrats, said she felt “gutted” on Monday.“I think there is a feeling across the board of, ‘What on earth is <location>Britain</location> doing?’ ” she said.Mr. Cameron has said he will resign by October, suggesting that <location>London</location> might wait until then to formally start the withdrawal process, but officials in <location>Brussels</location> want the pace sped up.Chancellor Angela Merkel of <location>Germany</location>, by contrast, has shown some sympathy for <location>Britain’s</location> play for time.Waiting until October to start negotiating on the terms of <location>Britain’s</location> exit and its future relationship with the bloc might give time for <location>Britain</location> to perhaps change its mind.But this would also slow any efforts to reshape a union that even the most stalwart fans of European integration acknowledge is far from perfect.Those who support the idea of turning <location>Europe</location> into a federal state are even hoping that the crisis set off by the British vote will invigorate their sagging cause, a prospect that is unlikely to fly.British opponents of the bloc campaigned on the idea that the constant meddling of unelected officials in <location>Brussels</location> was holding their country down and destroying its way of life.By banning weed killers, in one example.“Now EU Fat Cats Want to Ban Our Weed Killer,” read a headline in April in the Daily Express, a British tabloid that supported the Brexit campaign.In reality, officials in the European Commission have been pushing for months to extend an approval, first granted in 2002 and now set to expire on Friday, for the use in <location>Europe</location> of popular weed killers, like Roundup.But they had problems getting member states to agree in the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feeds.Delays by <location>France</location>, <location>Germany</location> and other governments meant that the issue, like many others in the European Union, continued to be kicked down the road.“The idea that we wanted a ban was just one of the false myths spread by British tabloids,” said Enricio Brivio, a spokesman for the European Commission’s department that deals with health and food safety.“What could we do?I do not know.” Mr. Agnew, the UKIP member of the European Parliament, acknowledged that the officials “had actually tried to do the right thing.” He nonetheless derided their fruitless efforts as a symptom of the “E.U.’s shambolic decision making.” As debates on weed killer and other matters continue in <location>Brussels</location>, the European Commission is trying to avoid a breakdown of its bureaucratic system in the event that the hundreds of British citizens working in the organization suddenly decide to leave.It has assured them that their jobs are safe despite their country’s vote to withdraw.The most senior Briton in the apparatus, the commissioner of financial services, Jonathan Hill, resigned over the weekend in response to the referendum result.Some lower officials are hanging tight for the moment, saying they did not come to <location>Brussels</location> just to work for <location>Britain</location>.It remains to be seen, many cautioned, whether <location>Brussels</location> gets the message that there needs to be fundamental reform of the European project.
