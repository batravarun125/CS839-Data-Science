The dough was finished in just five or six minutes, when it became very shiny.Ms. Kato coaxed the blob out onto a generous dusting of potato starch, which prevents the dough from sticking but doesn’t alter the flavor.After it cooled a bit, Ms. Kato folded pieces of the dough around fillings: anko, a traditional red bean paste made from adzuki beans and sugar; and a chocolate ganache that Ms. Kato had infused with just enough Earl Grey tea to give it a delicate whiff of bergamot.(Making anko from scratch takes some time, but the filling is available ready-made, in cans.For those who want to use it, Ms. Kato suggests popping it into a pan to dry it out a little first.)The mochi dough hardened as it cooled, but not much: It was still comically sticky.Home cooks can use a rolling pin, a lot of potato starch and a positive attitude to get the dough around fillings.Ms. Kato used her fingers, holding the dough in the air and spreading it across the bean paste so evenly that it was nearly translucent.Shaping neat, symmetrical daifuku is the trickiest part of the process to master, but the beginner can easily repair holes, or pinch off excess dough and hide a seam on the bottom.Ugly daifuku are still delicious and a joy to eat, the mochi yielding so easily that it feels as if it wants to be consumed.But the fresh dough deteriorates quickly, turning dry and stiff within just two days, and losing its lovely tender chewiness.Mochi enthusiasts know how to deal with this setback: Eat it all as soon as you can.Mochi ice cream has started to give the dough a much higher profile in the <location>United States</location>.<location>Mikawaya</location>, based in <location>Los Angeles</location>, started selling the product locally in the early 1990s, and pushed it into major supermarket chains.By 2014, Trader Joe’s was advertising a fully Americanized pumpkin pie mochi ice cream, just in time for Thanksgiving.“Mochi is right where the macaron was 10 years ago,” said Ken Gordon, who founded the <location>New York</location> mochi ice cream company Mochidoki.At Patisserie Tomoko, Ms. Kato also serves fresh mochi with ice cream.She cuts the dough into small pieces and scatters these on a plate with smudges of creamy white bean paste.She scoops a grassy, barely sweet green-tea sorbet onto white chocolate ganache, and garnishes it with coin-size meringues that break easily, then strings syrupy, candied yuzu zest across it all.It’s a fantastic clutter of textures.Sure, it tastes great, too, but that’s almost beside the point.Recipe: Sweet Mochi With Red Bean Filling
