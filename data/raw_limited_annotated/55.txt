Those pans were cast by now-famous makers like Griswold — and by dozens of now-anonymous foundries located in every sizable American town that also usually produced farm tools and weapons.Each pan was poured and polished by hand, a process that required hours of human labor but yielded a noticeable difference.“I fell in love with that smoothness,” said Mr. Whitehead of Finex.“But now that I make them, I realize why it went away.Labor is just so expensive.” Most of the new pans have smooth interiors and are sold preseasoned, which also explains their appeal to modern consumers.(There is a wealth of confusing and often contradictory information about seasoning online.)Each of the new makers has its own preferred system of cleaning and reseasoning, described on its website.But the basic principle is simple: Treat the pan as if you were a 19th-century cook, because the way people back then cooked and cleaned automatically seasoned their pans.Instead of plastic polymers, their skillets had natural coatings formed by cooking with fat and bonding fat molecules to the metal surface.So use the pan often, especially for projects like shallow frying or cooking bacon or browning chicken.Scrape the cooking surface clean with a stiff brush, a bench scraper or salt; rinse with very hot water and, if needed, a drop of soap; put it back on the stove over low heat until completely dry.It is not necessary to make a science project of creating the patina: Under these circumstances, it will simply happen.(If the pan is long unused, however, even the loveliest patina will become sticky, rusty or both.Store dry skillets in a cupboard or the oven to protect them from dust, with paper towels between them if stacked.)Nostalgia for old ways of cooking is powerful, but in this case it is also practical.“Cast iron is not responsive, but it is relentless,” said Nathan Myhrvold, the food scientist.No common cooking material has such a high “thermal mass,” or ability to absorb and store heat.Mr. Myhrvold, who runs a research center in Bellevue, Wash., called the Cooking Lab, which also produces the “Modernist Cuisine” books, said the common notion that cast iron is a good conductor of heat is a myth; in fact, the opposite is true.Cast iron grabs heat and holds on to it.“After you put the steak in contact with it, there’s a lot of spare heat left to cook with,” he said.“Cast iron doesn’t drop in temperature as much as thinner pans with better conductivity,” like aluminum and stainless steel.Thick-bottomed cast-iron pans evolved for use in charcoal embers and on wood stoves, when maximizing limited heat was the priority.In <location>Appalachia</location>, cast iron survived when many modern cooks switched to lighter pans, which heat up quickly on gas and electric stoves, Ms. Lundy said.“That skillet became part of the imagery of the Appalachian woman,” said Ms. Lundy, who identifies herself as a member of the “hillbilly diaspora” and has just published a cookbook called “Victuals.” She grew up in <location>Louisville</location>, and lives in <location>North Carolina</location>.Her family lived for at least four generations in <location>Corbin</location>., making everything from pork chops to cornbread, cobblers and even biscuits in cast iron.“The first thing any mountain cook will tell you is the history of her skillets,” she said.Soon, the same may be true of all cooks.Mr. Whitehead said a customer had recently come in to buy a Finex skillet after his first son was born.“The dad wants to start using it now,” he said, “so it will be ready for the boy when he turns 18.” Recipes: Flattened Chicken Thighs With Roasted Lemon Slices | Crisp Toffee Bars
