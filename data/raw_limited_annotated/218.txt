<location>DETROIT</location> — On the face of it, Ana Rivera could have had almost any choice when it came to educating her two sons.For all the abandoned buildings and burned-down houses in her neighborhood in the southwest part of this city, national charter school companies had seen a market and were setting up shop within blocks of each other, making it easier to find a charter school than to buy a carton of milk.But hers became the story of public education in a city grasping for its comeback: lots of choice, with no good choice.She enrolled her older son, Damian, at the charter school across from her house, where she could watch him walk into the building.He got all A’s and said he wanted to be an engineer.But the summer before seventh grade, he found himself in the back of a classroom at a science program at the University of <location>New York</location>, struggling to keep up with students from <location>Detroit's</location> Public Schools, known as the worst urban district in the nation.They knew the human body is made up of many cells; he had never learned that.When his school stopped assigning homework, Ms. Rivera tried enrolling Damian at other charters, but the deadlines were past, the applications onerous.Finally, she found him a scholarship at a Catholic school, where he struggled to rise above D’s all year.“He doesn’t want to hear the word engineering,” she said.<location>Michigan</location> leapt at the promise of charter schools 23 years ago, betting big that choice and competition would improve public schools.It got competition, and chaos.<location>Detroit</location> schools have long been in decline academically and financially.But over the past five years, divisive politics and educational ideology and a scramble for money have combined to produced a public education fiasco that is perhaps unparalleled in the <location>United States.</location>  While the idea was to foster academic competition, the unchecked growth of charters has created a glut of schools competing for some of the nation’s poorest students, enticing them to enroll with cash bonuses, laptops, raffle tickets for iPads and bicycles.Leaders of charter and traditional schools alike say they are being cannibalized, fighting so hard over students and the limited public dollars that follow them that no one thrives.<location>Detroit</location> now has a bigger share of students in charters than any American city except <location>New Orleans</location>, which turned almost all its schools into charters after Hurricane Katrina.But half the charters perform only as well, or worse than, <location>Detroit’s</location> traditional public schools.“The point was to raise all schools,” said Scott Romney, a lawyer and board member of <location>Detroit</location>, a civic group formed after the 1967 race riots here.“Instead, we’ve had a total and complete collapse of education in this city.” The city has emerged almost miraculously fast from the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history.<location>Detroit</location> hums with development — a maze of detours around construction sites with luxury apartments, a new Nike store along a stretch of prime but empty storefronts.Even where blight resumes a few blocks out, farm-to-table restaurants and modern design stores sprout hopefully.Last year, the city had its smallest population decline since the 1950s.But the city’s residents — many of them stranded here after whites and middle-class blacks fled in waves — will not share in any renaissance as long as only 10 percent of rising high school seniors score “college ready” on reading tests.“We’ll either invest in our own children and prepare them to fill these jobs, or I suppose maybe people will migrate from other places in the country to fill them,” said Thomas F. Stallworth III, a former state representative who steered the passage of the 2014 legislation that paved <location>Detroit’s</location> way out of bankruptcy.“If that’s the case, we are still left with this underbelly of generational poverty with no clear path out.” The 1993 state law permitting charter schools was not brought on by academic or financial crisis in <location>Detroit</location> — those would come later — but by a free-market-inclined governor, John Engler.An early warrior against public employee unions, he embraced the idea of creating schools that were publicly financed but independently run to force public schools to innovate.To throw the competition wide open, <location>Michigan</location> allowed an unusually large number of institutions, more than any other state, to create charters: public school districts, community colleges and universities.It gave those institutions a financial incentive: a 3 percent share of the dollars that go to the charter schools.And only they — not the governor, not the state commissioner or board of education — could shut down failing schools.For-profit companies seized on the opportunity; they now operate about 80 percent of charters in <location>Michigan</location>, far more than in any other state.The companies and those who grant the charters became major lobbying forces for unfettered growth of the schools, as did some of the state’s biggest Republican donors.Sometimes, they were one and the same, as with J. C. Huizenga, a Grand Rapids entrepreneur who founded <location>Michigan’s</location> largest charter school operator, the for-profit National Heritage Academies.Two of the biggest players in <location>Michigan</location> politics, Betsy and Dick DeVos — she the former head of the state Republican Party, he the heir to the Amway fortune and a 2006 candidate for governor — established the Great Lakes Education Project, which became the state’s most pugnacious protector of the charter school prerogative.Even as <location>Michigan</location> and <location>Detroit</location> continued to hemorrhage residents, the number of schools grew.The state has nearly 220,000 fewer students than it did in 2003, but more than 100 new charter schools.As elsewhere across the country, charters concentrated in urban areas, particularly <location>Detroit</location>, where the public schools had been put under state control in 1999.In 2009, it was found to be the lowest-performing urban school district on national tests.Operators were lining up to get into <location>New York</location>, and in 2011, after a conservative wave returned the governor’s office and the Legislature to Republican control for the first time in eight years, the Legislature abolished a cap that had limited the number of charter schools that universities could create to 150.Some charter school backers pushed for a so-called smart cap that would allow only successful charters to expand.
