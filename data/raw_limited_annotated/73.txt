There were several takers.“It was too short I think, and now we have a skirt and normal shirt,” said Roberta Vinci, a veteran player who said she had never had such a last-minute change from an apparel maker.“Nice and comfortable, and everything is now going to be O.K.for the players, I think.” Daria Kasatkina quickly opted for the switch as well.“I’m really happy that I have this opportunity, because if you feel good on the court you can play better,” Kasatkina said.“If something is bothering you all the time, no.I tried the dress during a practice, and I didn’t like it so much.It was always going up, so you can see the stomach, everything.It’s not very nice.” Sabine Lisicki, a 2013 Wimbledon finalist, also switched to the skirt and top, echoing that comfort on court was most important.“I didn’t feel comfortable showing that much,” Lisicki said, laughing.Samantha Crawford, who is 6 feet 2 inches, also made the switch, saying she had not worn tennis dresses on court in several years because she thinks they rarely suit a player of her height.“It looks cute on a lot of the girls — I saw Lauren Davis wearing it and it looks really cute,” Crawford said of Davis, who is 5 feet 2.“But I’m really tall, so I have that problem with every dress I try on.” Some players raved about the dress.Maria Sakkari wore it unaltered for her first two qualifying matches and has since worn it with the additional tailoring in two wins.She said it was one of her favorite tennis outfits.“I think it’s a very pretty dress, and I think that it’s very feminine,” Sakkari said.“It’s very comfortable.” Eugenie Bouchard, a 2014 finalist, was the player used to model the dress in Nike promotional materials.She defended the design.“For me, I love it,” Bouchard told the network TSN.“It’s nice and short so you can move around and be free with your movements.Yeah, I don’t know.It’s funny that people paid a lot of attention to it, but I really think it’s really nice.” One Nike-sponsored player not affected by the dress design was Serena Williams.Nike provides unique outfits for her.
