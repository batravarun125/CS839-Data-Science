Good morning.We’re trying something new this week: Today, a morning update for our <location>California</location> readers.Tell us what you’d like to see: CAtoday@nytimes.com We like to think of <location>California</location> as the center of the tech universe.But, apparently, all that know-how has not helped us figure out how to run more efficient elections.Three weeks after the state’s Democratic presidential primary, half a million votes remain uncounted.The final tallies, whenever they come in, are not expected to change the result.Hillary Clinton declared victory the night of the June 7 primary, when she was up by more than 10 points.In videos, in blog posts and on social media, some supporters of Bernie Sanders are pointing to the uncounted ballots as evidence that Mr. Sanders was robbed.Long waits for final totals are not rare in <location>California.</location>  Most of the 2.5 million votes that were not counted by June 7 were mail-in ballots that were not returned until Election Day, or even a few days after.But the vote also exposed “mechanical problems” in the electoral system, said Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data, a consulting firm based in <location>California</location>.A flood of voters registered right before the election.Many did not receive mail-in ballots until after Election Day, when they were useless.Independents voting by mail also had a hard time getting the right ballots.Both groups were more likely to support Mr. Sanders.Many cast provisional ballots, which take a long time to count because each has to be verified.Since June 7, Mr. Sanders has slightly cut into Ms. Clinton’s lead.She was ahead by roughly 440,000 votes on election night.Now, it’s 414,500, or about eight percentage points.Still, it’s a sizable margin.“The Bernie folks have legitimate gripes,” Mr. Mitchell said.“But they’re all going to be resolved when these provisional ballots are counted.” • Hillary Clinton released her technology policy initiative, which targets young entrepreneurs.It reflects a view that tech should be an engine of equality.• Facebook announced that it will be shifting your news feed away from, well, news, and toward posts by friends.Our tech columnist writes that the company will always prioritize baby pictures over keeping users informed.• American drivers are regaining their appetite for gas guzzlers, unloading hybrid and electric vehicles in favor of bigger cars, pickups and S.U.V.s.• Airbnb is now in disputes with both <location>San Francisco</location> and <location>New York</location> that could end up pushing thousands of illegal listings off the site.The company is in talks for a new round of investment that could value it at about $30 billion.• “An irresistible and indispensable 360-degree guide to the new technology establishment.” That’s our book reviewer’s take on “Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in <location>Silicon Valley</location>.” • The visitors to the <location>United States</location> may be asked to voluntarily disclose their social media accounts, a step that is intended to help in screening for ties to terrorism.
