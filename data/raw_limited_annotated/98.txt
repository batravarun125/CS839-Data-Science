A concussion left her “muddy” for months afterward, setting her behind in school and hurting her auditions for colleges.“I was talking to my mom about how different I am since 2014,” she said.“I’m more open, not afraid to try new things.Getting through the concussion and dislocation is a big deal.When I get home, I’m going straight into physical therapy.” The two winners arrived by different paths.Ms. Faye, who sang “Your Daddy’s Son,” from “Ragtime,” in a group medley and then “A New Life,” from “Jekyll & Hyde,” for her solo, has pursued musical theater seriously since ninth grade and plans to major in it at <location>Penn State</location> next year.“She said to me a year and a half ago, ‘I love musical theater, but I’m going into law,’” her high school’s music director, Marty Gregory, said.“And I said to her: ‘Yeah, right.Let’s not get carried away here with reality.Dream the dream.’” Mr. Strobl, by contrast, was more interested in singing in alternative-rock bands until an audience member at a show encouraged him to give musical theater a shot.“I hadn’t gotten into acting until this year,” he said.This year’s upbeat awards, in which the students were repeatedly hailed as <location>Broadway’s</location> future, came during a season in which seven of the 11 new musicals in <location>Broadway</location> have closed or are closing.The opening number included snippets from some of the successes, including “Waitress” and “Hamilton.” The awards M.C., Zachary Levi, noted that his own show, the Tony-nominated musical “She Loves Me,” was closing in two weeks, and encouraged the audience to buy tickets.“Time is money, folks,” he said.Besides solo performances, many of the students performed in costume in small-group medleys.(One Wednesday and two Gomezes from “The Addams Family” musical turned up, for example.)Watching a group of boys, Van Kaplan, a co-founder of the awards program and the show’s director, said it was often hard to remember that the performers were high school students: “I have to stop and say, some of them are just 16.” Many parents also came to <location>New York</location> for the event, but they were kept away from their children until after the final ceremony.Until then, the students were in the care of chaperones.“I text my mom, but I haven’t seen her,” Sarah Chico, 17, a junior from <location>Tucson</location>, said on Saturday, the last day of coaching before the students performed for judges behind closed doors on Sunday.
