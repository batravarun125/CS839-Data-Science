Unlike the 1800s, stories today benefit from instant delivery through the internet and social media.One of the better-known purveyors is Alex Jones, who hosts an internet show at the website infowars.com.The day of the <location>Orlando</location> shooting, he posted a video in which he asserted that the government had let the massacre happen so it could pass “hate laws to deal with right-wingers” and to disarm gun owners.He did not respond to an email seeking comment .Mike Rothschild of <location>California</location>, who has researched and written about conspiracy theories, described the world of false-flag believers as a “bank of awakened internet sleuths that has got it all figured out.” They see it as their duty to warn others about secret elites in government who are plotting against citizens, he said.If overwhelming concrete evidence debunks the theorists’ notions, it only reinforces their ideas, said Chip Berlet, a researcher of radical-right movements and retired analyst at Political Research Associates, a left-leaning think tank in <location>Texas</location>.For conspiracy believers, explaining it away “shows how smart the enemy really is,” he said.Rob Brotherton, a psychologist and science journalist who wrote “Suspicious Minds: Why We Believe Conspiracy Theories,” said it is not just false-flaggers who seek connections and hidden meanings in world events.“Everybody loves a story with a good plot twist, which is basically what conspiracy theories are,” he wrote in an email.“Conspiracy theories arguably just have slightly different logic and standards of evidence.” But does paying attention to such theories give them legitimacy?Mr. Rothschild said it was better for the public to be knowledgeable about rather than blindsided by such stories.Another conspiracy researcher, Joseph E. Uscinski, a political science professor in <location>Miami</location>, has noted that such theories rarely go unchallenged and are frequently debunked on the internet, Mr. Brotherton said.Still, trying to quash conspiracists can be a no-win proposition.“For someone who believes in a conspiracy, you can’t go wrong,” Derek Arnold, who teaches communications at Villanova University in <location>Pennsylvania</location>, wrote in an email.“If the powers that be give you information that is against your theory, it’s a lie; if it supports your theory, you are even more vindicated.And if they stay silent, it’s because you’ve got something to hide.”
