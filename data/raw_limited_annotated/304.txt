Democrats charged that Republicans had booby-trapped the legislation by adding provisions that would restrict the role of Planned Parenthood, the women’s health organization, and similar clinics in providing contraceptive services related to fighting the Zika virus, which can be transmitted sexually.The Democrats also said that Republicans had inserted a provision cutting $540 million in financing from the Affordable Care Act, President Obama’s signature health care law, and that they had stripped a House provision that would ban the flying of the Confederate battle flag in federal cemeteries.Another provision of the bill that Democrats disliked was a further reallocation of money from <location>Ebola</location> programs, totaling $107 million.Democrats have long maintained that money previously appropriated to fight Ebola is vitally needed.Even as officials brace for the arrival in the continental <location>United States</location> of mosquitoes carrying Zika, the Obama administration does have some flexibility in reapportioning funds among different health programs — in addition to the nearly $600 million already taken from Ebola programs — while waiting for Congress to act.The White House has been reluctant to specify how much money it might be able to temporarily redirect to fight Zika — or how long it would be able to make do — because that could ease pressure on Congress to approve the new money.Whichever side is more to blame, it was clear that no new government funds would be approved to fight the Zika virus until after Congress returned from a recess for the Fourth of July holiday.And even then, the prospects of an agreement are uncertain.With Southern states expected to be hit hardest by Zika, lawmakers representing <location>Florida</location> have been among those pushing hardest for bipartisan action.But even Floridians were divided on Tuesday.Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of <location>Florida</location>, said Republicans had poisoned the chances for moving ahead by blocking money for Planned Parenthood, knowing Democrats would never agree.“They’re just not living in the real world, and they’re just not facing the fact that this is an emergency,” Mr. Nelson said.He noted that at least five babies had been born with microcephaly in the <location>United States</location> — the most recent one in <location>Florida</location> — but said he expected the disagreements to continue.“We go until enough of these horrible cases are born that it is finally beginning to penetrate their hard heads,” he said.Senator Marco Rubio, Mr. Nelson’s Republican counterpart from <location>Florida</location>, blamed Democrats’ political motives for sinking the bill.“It’s a talking point that they want to take into the July Fourth recess, unfortunately,” Mr. Rubio said.Democrats on Tuesday morning urged renewed negotiations, but Mr. Cornyn, speaking to reporters off the floor, said matter-of-factly, “There’s not going to be another opportunity to deal with this for the near future.” The vote on Tuesday morning was 52 to 48, with Republicans falling short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster and advance the bill to a final vote.The debate was so sharp that Senator John Barrasso, accused Democrats of favoring insects over people in their opposition to easing the pesticide restrictions.“The Democrats are more focused on protecting the mosquito than they are protecting people,” he said.
