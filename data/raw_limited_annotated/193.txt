In this series for T, the writer and author of “Worn Stories,” Emily Spivack, interviews creative types about their most prized possessions.As the co-creator of Marcel the Shell — a tiny creature with a big heart — it may come as no surprise that Jenny Slate has a thing for small animals.Here, the comedian and actress (and voice in the upcoming animated film “The Secret Life of Pets”) discusses the great pleasure she takes in them, and one diminutive wooden rabbit she holds dear.For my whole life I have been interested in small animals that are doing their own thing in a big world — animals that are unaware of whether they’re big or small.I started to collect wooden animals like these rabbits because the objects were so peaceful to me.I have this habit of giving myself little treats, either when I am happy or when I am sad, and I have about 10 of them.The animals are painted with colors that aren’t really part of the color palette for toys today — they are the color of vegetables and <location>Sesame</location> street in the 1980s.I love rabbits.I love them so much.They’re wise and gentle and they are very, very quiet.I love “Watership Down” and “The Velvet Rabbit.” When I was little, my mom would say, “Quick like a bunny!” whenever it was time to get ready for bed, and that made me want to do it.Sometimes I’ll keep one of these rabbits in my bag.I’ll keep it there to calm myself down and nobody knows it’s there.I love having a little secret that doesn’t hurt anybody and that’s a reassertion of myself.I tend to be calm and happy when I’m looking at things like this rabbit, which remind me of when I was younger and only knew how to be myself.When I was little I felt that there was something alive in my stuffed animals and in this Madame Alexander doll I slept with every night named Pudding.I slept with 36 stuffed animals and they were in a specific rotation so that each could get a night sleeping next to me.I didn’t want to hurt their feelings.
