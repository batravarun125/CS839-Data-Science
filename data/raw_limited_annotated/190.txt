Aska Fredrik Berselius’s decision to use the name of his last restaurant for his next one came late in the game.And it was one of the few easy parts of building and opening the new place.The tall, lanky Swedish chef, who closed his much-lauded new-Nordic restaurant two years ago, went through months of searching for space, then ran into complications with construction.Now, almost a year late, the square black room, one corner of which is taken up with an open kitchen, is ready.“I did not want one of those long, narrow dining rooms,” Mr. Berselius said.The restaurant has a spacious garden and a downstairs white-brick bar and lounge.(The dining room has no bar, like a growing number of restaurants.)For his 12- to 15-course tasting menus, which change daily, he is considering dishes like hake smoked in hay, and dry-aged beef with cured beef fat and salted gooseberries.Mr. Berselius is planning to find as many ingredients as possible in the northeast; caviar from <location>Finland</location> will be one of his few imports.
