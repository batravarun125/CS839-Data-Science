I have rarely experienced as much anxiety as I did when faced with all those leathers and hardware options.And I didn’t even have to live with the results of my choices — someone else did (it was auctioned for charity).Nevertheless, I was racked with self-doubt.What if I messed up?Seeing little squares of suede and nappa and trying to imagine them supersized on a tote bag was almost impossible.I spent hours hemming and hawing, and, even with the advice of the extraordinarily patient Fendi Made to Order expert, was unconvinced it would all be O.K.in the end.Maybe that simply reveals my own lack of imagination — those who can’t do, critique — but I doubt I am alone here.It’s one thing to do what my friends and I did in high school: Take your old jeans, chop them off at the knees, slice them up the seams and make them into “new” denim skirts by inserting assorted fabrics into the middle.It’s an entirely different thing to do something similar with an investment garment you will have for years.What you love today — what expresses your attitudes and obsessions at this political and social moment — you may find excruciatingly embarrassing tomorrow.This is especially true of things such as the patches available on Gucci and OC jackets, for example: It could seem completely apropos to decorate your bomber with, say, bees and snakes, or emojis, hamburgers and pizza, at the moment, but in two years might just seem laughable.A young friend likened the personalization project to tattoos, only safer and less painful.But if that is the comparable then we might consider the lesson of Johnny Depp and the seemingly painful laser transformation of his “Winona Forever” ink into “Wino Forever.” To wit: Think twice (or three times) about what you choose for posterity, lest you become one of those marked, literally, by regret.Or clad in it.Theoretically there are protections built in to the customization process, in that the options have been approved by the designer and there are advisers on hand (though how they might steer a would-be buyer away from a mistake in a world where the mantra is “the customer is always right,” I wonder).At least when it comes to the Jimmy Choo offering, nothing is irrevocable since everything is removable; the buttons come with coverings in the same fabric as the shoe or bag, so they look more like three-dimensional polka dots.Though it is more than possible to go over the top with attaching the sparkles.Anya Hindmarch, the designer who helped restart the craze with her bag stickers — permanent decals you attach to your handbags — said she sees the safety net as the fact that she still designs the bag (the canvas); it is only the adornment that is optional.Gucci has preselected the places where Do it yourselfers can choose to put their desired patch or initials or embroidery, and Carol Lim of Opening Ceremony said she and her co-founder, Humberto believed that their varsity jacket was recognizable enough on its own, no matter the decoration.Still, she mused, “If someone wanted to go really crazy and embellish everywhere, would we say, ‘You can’t do that?’ We haven’t so far.” There is a lot of upside to individual expression, but do not forget: The mistakes you make will be your own.
