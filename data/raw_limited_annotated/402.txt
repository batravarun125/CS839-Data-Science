The people were of many colors and faiths, and there were many pilgrims.In the Old City, all three faiths — Christianity, Judaism, Islam — commingled, with sacred sites sometimes just a few feet away from one another.The next day I visited Haifa.It appeared less tense than <location>Jerusalem</location>, and in some places the mixing of different people was beautifully manifest.There you could use shalom and as-salamu alaykum interchangeably.I also visited the Baha’i gardens, at the heart of which stands the golden-domed Shrine of the Báb, the resting place of the prophet-herald of the Baha’i faith.The gardens were immensely beautiful, but I was reminded that <location>Gaza</location> has only one public garden: the Unknown corner, where jobless and poor people sit and watch each other.Then came my most poignant experience: A friend drove me to <location>Tiberias</location>, a small city on the shores of the <location>Galilee</location>.Starving after many hours without food, I ate dinner at a nearby kibbutz’s restaurant for tourists.When I asked why the streets were empty, I was reminded that it was the Jewish Sabbath.I entered the restaurant and found people eating and laughing together.I was nervous; earlier in the day there had been tensions at the border, between <location>Hamas</location> and <location>Israel</location>.But my curiosity kept me from leaving.I ate salmon and drank Pepsi.I worried about what everyone would do if they discovered I was a Palestinian.But nobody seemed suspicious.I also thought about what Palestinians would say if they knew I entered and ate in such a place like a normal tourist.Some Palestinians, I thought, might see this as a crime of treason, a normalization with the “enemy.” I exchanged smiles with several people.Maybe they thought I was Korean, as sometimes happens in <location>Gaza</location>.What I noticed during my meal was a sense of harmony, love and unity.It was overwhelming.I saw maybe one or two tables of big families: children doing their homework, women chatting with each other.Around this time, my friends and colleagues called to say that three babies had burned to death in their home at a refugee camp in <location>Gaza</location>.The fire was started by a candle that was being used during a power outage.I cried the next morning; it felt too normal.I visited Israel’s border with <location>Jordan</location> and <location>Syria</location>.I saw ruins — of houses and of a mosque — that reminded me of <location>Gaza</location>.The buildings were left destroyed after the war between <location>Israel</location> and <location>Syria</location>.There was graffiti on the walls in Hebrew, Arabic and English: a big pink heart with “BFF” written inside, dedications and love letters, a sentence in Arabic declaring that ISIS had arrived here, Allahu akbar, and the word “<location>Gaza</location>.” I interviewed one family who was visiting the place.It was empty and calm.The walls were black, as if they’d been set on fire.I wondered what had happened to the people who used to live and pray here.Two days after I returned to <location>Gaza</location>, I visited the mobile home of a displaced family whose previous home had been destroyed during the last war.It was close to the border fence.The moment I entered, I thought of the Israeli kibbutz.There was a similar sense of harmony.But here, in the “Caravan Quarter” of Beit Hanoun, in northern <location>Gaza</location>, there were no restaurants, no schools, no nature.
