 Since his early days as a <location>Chicago</location> beat maker, Kanye West has been a master of sampling — only the scale and the canvases have changed.In the new music video for “Famous,” which depicts a row of nude celebrities, including Taylor Swift and Donald J. Trump, asleep in bed with the rapper and his wife, Kim Kardashian, the references are to contemporary art: The video was inspired most directly by Vincent Desiderio’s painting “Sleep,” a fact the artist did not learn until Friday, the morning of the video’s premiere.The evening before, Mr. Desiderio, 60, was told cryptically that he was wanted in <location>Los Angeles</location> immediately.“I couldn’t hear properly when my gallery called, and when they said ‘Kanye West,’ I thought they said ‘Condé Nast,’” he said.Despite not being told exactly why, and though he had only a passing familiarity with Mr. West’s music, Mr. Desiderio made the trip from <location>New York</location> — the flight was paid for — and without even stopping at his hotel, was whisked to meet the rapper.“It was almost as if they were throwing a small surprise party for me,” he said of Mr. West and his team.“They were all smiling like the cat who ate the canary.Then they sat me down and asked if I’d like to see what they’d been working on.” What followed was a voyeur’s view of some of the most recognizable (and notorious) figures in American pop culture and politics — Bill Cosby, George W. Bush, Chris Brown and others — arranged in a tableau borrowed from Mr. Desiderio’s work (itself inspired by a Jackson Pollock mural commissioned for Peggy Guggenheim).He was elated.“I was almost in tears,” Mr. Desiderio said.“We just hugged each other.” Back at his studio in <location>N.Y.</location>, the artist, who is also a senior critic at the New York Academy of Art, discussed his impressions of Mr. West and the bridge between the art world and hip-hop.Below are edited excerpts from the conversation.What was your initial reaction to the video?As I’m watching the thing, they’re smiling and filming my response, and all of a sudden, I realized that it is my “Sleep” painting: “Holy [expletive]!Oh my God!’ I was really speechless.Kanye saw things in it that I don’t know how he could’ve seen.Kanye is truly an artist.Talking to him was like speaking to any of my peers in the art world — actually, more like talking to the brightest art students that have their eyes wide open.Were you familiar with his work?My children would talk about him.The craziest thing that’s happened so far is that all of a sudden, I’ve achieved the status of a demigod among them and their friends.Did you give legal permission for Kanye to refer to your painting?As far as I’m concerned, it has nothing to do with copyright.A work of art goes out there, and there’s a stream that activates and widens the communal imagination.It was an honor that I was being quoted.
