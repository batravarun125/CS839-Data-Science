The textbook, first issued to high school seniors in <location>Jiangxi Province</location> in 2004, is old and seems to have had a limited circulation.Apparently embarrassed by the outcry, the publisher, told Sixth Tone the book would be revised.In a broader sense, the antiquated attitude of the school system is not keeping up with the sexual revolution in <location>China</location>.A 2012 survey published by a magazine of the central government showed 70 percent of Chinese had had premarital sex, up from just 15 percent of those surveyed in 1989.A women’s rights advocate, Xiao Meili, 27, said the text reflected “a common idea among the Chinese public.” She added: “It is the same in Western countries in ancient times.To solve sexual problems?Try abstinence.” For contemporary Chinese girls, the story line is dangerous, she said.“These words will hurt the young girls; they objectify women.They treat a woman as a thing, an asset.” Ms. Xiao, who walked 1,600 miles from <location>Beijing</location> to <location>Guangzhou</location> in 2014 to raise awareness of sexual abuse, said her generation had received “basically zero” sex education.Xiong Jing, 28, the editor of the website Gender Watch, said there was an upside to the debate because it showed that values were changing.“Many Chinese now won’t accept these biases anymore because they receive more education and more information from the internet,” she said.
