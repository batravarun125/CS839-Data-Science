“I think it’s just a matter of trying too hard, thinking a little too much,” Franklin said, referring to her disappointing swims in the backstroke.“Now it’s just about trusting myself and letting it happen.” But how does she lock into the cruise control that was her natural state as a teenager?“From what I remember in 2012, I was kind of oblivious to everything that was going on,” Franklin said, “so I’m kind of trying to channel that a little bit.” After the 2012 Olympics, Michael Phelps’s coach, Bob Bowman, gave Franklin a piece of advice that has stuck with her.He told her that she would face heightened expectations.She could view them one of two ways: as added pressure or additional support.But for a people pleaser, that’s a double-edged sword.Support can be its own burden.“Having that practice of looking at those expectations as support, of people really believing that I can do what I did in 2012 again,” Franklin said, “that’s something that makes me feel so appreciated and so grateful and makes me want to go out there and make those people proud for believing in me.” The eight-day competition is shaping up as a drawn-out retirement ceremony for the old guard: Eight of the first 10 finals produced winners that will be Olympic rookies.Aside from Lochte and Franklin, the veterans toppled included Matt Grevers, the reigning Olympic champion in the 100 backstroke, who finished third behind Ryan Murphy, 20, and David Plummer, 30; and Jessica Hardy, 29, who finished sixth in the 100 breaststroke, 2.53 seconds behind the winner, 19-year-old Lilly King.Once upon a time, the new crop of stars included Kate Ziegler, who broke Janet Evans’s 19-year-old world record in the 1,500-meter free at age 17 and graced the 2008 and 2012 Olympic teams.Ziegler, 28, came out of retirement less than two years ago and finished 86th in the preliminaries of the 200-meter freestyle, nearly nine seconds behind Katie Ledecky’s pace-setting 1:55.60.Ziegler said she is happier now than she was during her peak years, when she made herself miserable by “always looking for the next thing.” Ziegler added: “Part of this journey is re-evaluating where swimming belongs in my life.It no longer defines me.I know who I am, and I don’t need to be validated through my swimming.” Neither, it would appear, does Maya DiRado, 23, who qualified Sunday for her first Olympics in the 400 individual medley and placed first Tuesday night in the 200 I.M.semifinals in 2:10.09.DiRado, who graduated from Stanford in 2014, insists that her first Olympics will also be her last.She is scheduled to start a job with a management consulting firm in <location>Atlanta</location> in the fall.“Some people see it as, ‘Oh, you’re swimming so well so why not keep going?’” DiRado said.“But I think part of the reason why I am swimming so well is knowing that I have a hard stop date.” Dan Greaves, who coached DiRado when she was an age-grouper in <location>Santa Rosa</location>, in <location>California</location>, said he would not be surprised if she returned to swimming at some point.Why?“It’s hard to leave this sport,” Greaves said.“It gets in your soul.” Sometimes it takes a shove from a hungry youngster to break the spell.
