One key to developing the technique, Dr. Gluyas said, is understanding how helium is released from the rock in which it forms.Ordinarily, a helium atom stays within the rock’s crystal lattice.“You need a heating event to kick it out,” he said.The other regions of magma in the earth can be enough to release the gas, he said.Once released, the helium has to be trapped by underground formations — generally the same kind of formations that can trap natural gas, and that can be found using the same kind of seismic studies that are undertaken for oil and gas exploration.The helium, which is mixed with other gases, can be recovered the same way natural gas is: by drilling a well.Working with scientists from the University of <location>Oxford</location> and a small start-up company called Helium One, the researchers prospected in a part of <location>Tanzania</location> where studies from the 1960s suggested helium might be seeping from the ground.The area is within t a region where one of Earth’s tectonic plates is splitting.The rifting has created many volcanoes.Dr. Gluyas said the gas discovered in <location>Tanzania</location> may be as much as 10 percent helium, a huge proportion compared with most other sources.The researchers say the reservoir might contain as much as 54 billion cubic feet of the gas, or more than twice the amount currently in the Federal Helium Reserve, near <location>Amarillo</location>, <location>Texas</location>, which supplies about 40 percent of the helium used in the <location>United States</location> and is being drawn down.The next step would be for Helium One or one of the major helium suppliers around the world to exploit the find.But for Dr. Gluyas, the research opens up the possibility of finding the gas in new places.“We’re in the position where we could map the whole world and say these are the sorts of areas where you’d find high helium,” he said.
