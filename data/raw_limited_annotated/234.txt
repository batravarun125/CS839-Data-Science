In Alice Waese’s Fort Greene home and studio, alongside a bookcase piled high with others’ adventures, are shelves filled with objects that illustrate her own story as a jewelry designer.Meteorite-like silver rings, among the first pieces she made six years ago, lie near sleek double-finger rings that resemble mini Richard Serra sculptures.She points to a solid-gold bobby pin and turns over a new unfinished bracelet lined with silver pistachios that open and close.“I have a bit more of a commercial sensibility at this point, but it’s an evolution of what I’ve always done,” says Waese, a former design assistant to Maria Cornejo who began selling pieces in 2010, while in art school, at the <location>London</location> shop Hostem.“It’s still stream-of-consciousness.I start somewhere and end up someplace else.” Her fallwinter 2016 collection, due in stores like IF Boutique, <location>Tokyo’s</location> Arts & Science and, of course, Hostem, next month, is rooted in a series of fantastical drawings from her imagination.Some of the items (a gold swan ring with emerald eyes and a necklace bearing a spoon pendant) appear to be reproduced directly from Waese’s sketches, and all have a naïveté about them.
