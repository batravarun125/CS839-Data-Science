Prepaid cards currently lack some of the consumer protections that apply to bank accounts and credit cards, but the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a set of proposed rules in November 2014 that would help to close this gap.The new rules would require card issuers to standardized their fee disclosures, limit customers’ financial responsibility for fraudulent charges, and investigate errors and resolve them quickly.The consumer bureau has broad power to issues such rules, which do not require congressional approval.A final version of the regulations is expected within the next few months.In their letter, the senators also asked what information the companies had reported to the consumer bureau about the malfunctions, urging the watchdog agency to take a closer look at the prepaid card market.MasterCard has acknowledged a “slowdown” last month that created problems for some Walmart cardholders.“We caught it right away and worked closely with Green Dot to address the issues,” the company said.Green Dot said that, during the affected period, it had “maintained ongoing and real-time communication with our regulators and will provide any information related to this inquiry as appropriate.” Walmart did not immediately respond to requests for comment.After last month’s problems, Green Dot executives acknowledged “technical issues” and apologized to those affected.“We are taking steps to make sure this never happens again,” they wrote in a statement.The consumer bureau began accepting consumer complaints about prepaid cards in July 2014.It has received more than 5,000 so far, averaging around 215 a month, according to the agency’s latest complaint report.
