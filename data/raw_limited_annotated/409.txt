“I used these mushy, childlike textures,” she says, explaining that she did the first ones herself in wax and then developed molds using lost-wax casting for production in <location>Manhattan’s</location> jewelry district.“For the stones, I carved out holes and set them in there, and melted around them — I didn’t use any prongs, so each piece ends up being a little different.” Waese champions a “season-less” approach (“so the pieces can be passed on for generations and they pick up a person’s energy,” she says), although she shows her jewelry alongside the pair of clothing collections she designs per year.And three clothing seasons in, she considers herself a part of the fashion world about as much as she does the jewelry world, which is to say: not very much.Waese maintains that “it’s possible to be a niche brand and to grow slowly and respectfully.Getting lots of attention isn’t the goal,” she continues.“The goal is well-conceived orders that don’t compromise on quality.That’s satisfying for me — and magical.”
