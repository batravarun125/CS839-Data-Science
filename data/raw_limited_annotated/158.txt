<location>SAN FRANCISCO</location> — Pinterest announced on Tuesday new shopping-focused features that will make it easier for users to buy things they find on the site.The updates are part of Pinterest’s attempt to distance itself from comparisons to social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.Pinterest wants to be known as a network for inspiration in topics like travel, cooking and crafts, as well as for shopping both on and offline.At bottom, the site sees itself more as a competitor to Google — a way to search, discover and ultimately buy.“Shopping with Pinterest is meant to be that bridge between getting inspiration and actually making it a part of your life,” Ben Silbermann, the chief executive, said at an event at the company’s <location>San Francisco</location> headquarters on Tuesday.
