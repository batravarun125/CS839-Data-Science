A private secondary market for these types of shares grew up around pre-I.P.O.Facebook stock, but many venture-backed companies place restrictions on the ability of employees to sell the stock they receive in an option exercise until there is a liquidity event like an initial offering or sale.Palantir did not impose restrictions on employees or stockholders selling shares in the private market.Perhaps as a way to get current and former employees to participate, Palantir’s repurchase offer threatened to make it harder to resell the company’s stock in the private market.Employees need to consider another headache – taxes.Not only must employees put up cash to exercise their options, they must pay taxes, which can be an extraordinary amount if the private company has a high valuation.But because the company is not public yet, one cannot even be sure that valuations will materialize, particularly in the era of the overvalued start-up.This was a problem in the day of the tech bubble.Employees exercised options worth millions of dollars but found that when taxes were due, their companies and stock were worthless.Mr. Kupor recommends extending the vesting period to conform with the longer time it takes for a company to go public.He also suggests a longer period for employees to exercise options after they leave, up to 10 years.That figure is endorsed by Y Combinator in an argument that any lesser period is unfair to employees.Palantir gives departing employees three years to exercise their options.Other companies have adopted the 10-year period for employees leaving after two years.The downside is that this solution can lead to a mass exodus after two years as employees race to their next start-up, options safely in hand.Mr. Kupor notes that extending the exercise time for former employees makes their options more valuable at the expense of employees and investors.(It does so because former employees have a longer time to exercise their options and dilute the other shareholders.)Mr. Kupor has no solution other than to allow companies to extend the time at their discretion.But as we see in the Palantir case, companies can pick and choose favorites, or even refuse to accommodate former employees.The Palantir repurchase and Andreessen Horowitz’s ruminations highlight a more fundamental point: Compensation at venture-backed companies needs to be rethought in an age when many of these companies are staying private longer.In this new world, employees face sale restrictions that only their companies can lift.This forces these companies to provide periodic liquidity events.For instance, Airbnb, the short-term rental site, is making annual stock repurchases.In the public realm where companies are steadily profitable, stock buybacks are a familiar occurrence.More than half a trillion dollars was spent on stock buybacks in the public markets in 2015.But as the value of private, venture-backed companies deflates, they will struggle to give liquidity to their employees.There may be other ways to change compensation.Although options are the lifeblood of <location>Silicon Valley</location>, Palantir raised salaries 20 percent to stem employee attrition.But cash will not solve the problem, either.And so we await the great revamping.In the meantime, former employees of hot start-ups will be faced with choices like the one Palantir is offering: Take our money, whatever we offer, or be stuck.
