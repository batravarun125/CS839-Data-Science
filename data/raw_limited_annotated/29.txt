That “thing,” it turns out, is a user of Snapchat to promote herself and her clientele, which currently includes the rapper 070 Shake, Muzik headphones and the instant-messaging app Viber.“What I’m really good at,” she said, “is, if you have a TV show or movie or song or anything you’re trying to promote, I have a great way of making a couple hundred thousand people want to know about it.” Talent agencies have taken notice.Daniel Saynt, a founder of Socialyte, an agency that specializes in influencer casting, said, “I’d be surprised if she isn’t already talking to people about a reality show because of how well her content would fit with MTV or E!Entertainment.” But she already is the star of her own reality show, one that she extemporaneously films, directs and produces.And her teenage and 20-something fans are of a generation that prefers social media celebrities over traditional ones.“Reality TV became so fake that people wanted real reality,” Ms. Goddard said, trying to explain her appeal.“Not from someone who’s a multimillionaire, from somebody they feel they can almost touch.” Snapchat’s raw, charmingly lo-fi style means that it still seems undiscovered by prying grown-ups, despite its raising $1.8 billion recently and surpassing Twitter in the number of active users.And while global brands have already colonized Facebook and Instagram, Snapchat still seems on the fringe.“On Instagram, you can be fake,” Ms. Goddard said.“You take a picture, filter it, photoshop it, put it up and let people think that’s your life.Snapchat is the complete opposite.” Raised in <location>Tampa</location>, Ms. Goddard made her mark in <location>Miami</location> by promoting parties at the <location>South Beach</location> clubs Liv and Story, where she would chaperone celebrities like Dwyane Wade and David Beckham.Her energetic personality often made her the life of the party, so she started the YesJulz Agency in 2014 to capitalize on the nebulous intersection of night life, social media and marketing.Though she was active on Instagram and Twitter, her game-changing moment came when Snapchat introduced the story feature in 2013, allowing users to string together short video clips to create a narrative.It seemed tailor-made for her staccato, celebrity-filled life.She trained the camera on herself and tapped “record.” An early boost came when Ryan Seacrest named her one of the best Snapchat users to follow in 2014.Brands started calling.“Working with someone like Julz, it gives us insight into how to stay relevant,” said Adam Petrick, the global director of marketing at Puma, which hired Ms. Goddard this year as its brand ambassador.“She’s very multifaceted and outgoing in her interests.She perfectly represents our consumer.” In addition to wearing Puma products on Snapchat, Ms. Goddard recently shared a 40 percent discount code with her followers, and often tags posts of herself in athleisure outfits with the hashtag #PumaGal.While Mr. Petrick declined to get into specifics of the deal, industry insiders like Mr. Saynt from <location>Socialyte</location> estimate that Ms. Goddard can earn anywhere from $25,000 to $1 million for a campaign.He said that his company recently booked two influencer campaigns for $200,000 each.If the party never ends, neither does the work.Rather than complain, Ms Goddard has turned the always-on mentality into a brand-able moment, with the hashtag #NeverNotWorking.Her work ethos was on display during <location>New York</location> Fashion Week in February, when she was in the city to introduce her client, 070 Shake, to record-label executives at RCA and to fellow hip-hop artists.Ms. Goddard slid into a booth at the Midtown Italian restaurant Serafina on a cold Wednesday.She ordered a salad and tempted fate by pairing it with a glass of red wine, despite wearing a white Stella McCartney blazer.While talking, she was lit from below as she toggled between her two phones, both of which were constantly lighting up with Snapchat alerts, and one of which was getting juice from an external battery pack.Dinner, like everything else in Ms. Goddard’s life, was quick.She had another dinner scheduled that night, along with a concert at Webster Hall, and a party after that.After settling the tab, she scrolled through her phones, scanning for anything important.Then she put it away and sighed.She had places to be.“Things are moving so fast,” she said.“It’s hard for people not of this world to keep up.The people in the industry who were here before us didn’t grow up with a phone in their hands.They didn’t even grow up in the MySpace era.They were already famous.”
