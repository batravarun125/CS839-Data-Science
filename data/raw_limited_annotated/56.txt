In many cases, the children slide drawers out from a dresser and then try to climb them like stairs.In a moment, an everyday item becomes lethal.The commission said all six of the children crushed to death by Ikea furniture were 3 years old or younger.It also received reports of 36 injuries to children, it said.Ikea’s recall applies to eight million chests and drawers in the company’s popular Malm line, the style involved in each of the last three deaths from 2014 to 2016.The latest case, in February, added new urgency to the recall campaign.According to police records obtained by Philly.com, a woman in <location>Minnesota</location> went into her toddler’s bedroom to check on him during a nap and found him crushed beneath a six-drawer Malm dresser.Emergency medical workers were unable to revive him.Most American furniture manufacturers adhere to voluntary safety standards, which ensure that a unit will not tip over when a drawer is extended and 50 pounds of weight is applied.The recall on Tuesday applies to all Ikea furniture that fails that test, the commission said.Last summer, Ikea offered free wall anchor kits to owners of its furniture, a step that consumer advocates dismissed as inadequate given that many consumers were unaware of the dangers posed by unsecured furniture.As part of the agreement on Tuesday, Ikea agreed to pick up the recalled furniture from customers’ homes and issue a refund, or to install an anchor that secures them to the wall.It also applies to customers in <location>Canada</location>, where a 6.6 million units of the recalled furniture was sold.Mr. Kaye, the safety commission chairman, said on Tuesday that he was encouraged by Ikea’s willingness make changes, adding, “That doesn’t exonerate them from the past, but it is, from a consumer-safety standpoint, a positive announcement.” Asked whether any other retailers were selling furniture that posed risks to children, he said, “The best I can say at this point is our investigation continues, but that Ikea is not alone.”
