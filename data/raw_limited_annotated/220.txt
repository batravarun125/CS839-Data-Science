<location>SAN FRANCISCO</location> — The city of <location>Oakland</location>, on Monday banned the transport and storage of large coal shipments, a blow to a developer’s plans to use a former Army base as an export terminal to ship coal to <location>China</location> and other overseas markets.The terminal would have been the largest coal shipment facility on the West Coast, with a planned capacity to increase coal exports in the <location>United States</location> by 19 percent, according to the Sierra Club, the environmental group.Weeks of feisty debate over the ban, which the <location>Oakland</location> city Council unanimously passed late Monday night and which will become law after a second reading next month, covered familiar ground: the trade-offs between jobs and environmental concerns.But the debate also raised the larger and more unusual question of how much a city should weigh the global environmental impacts of the commodities that flow through its ports.A report prepared by the city argued for a coal ban partly because the coal, once it was burned overseas, would contribute to climate change and rising sea levels.“<location>Oakland</location> cannot afford to ignore the scientific evidence that clearly show the harmful effects and risk associated with coal,” said Dan Kalb, a <location>New York</location> city's Council member who proposed the ban along with the mayor, Libby Schaaf.“With this new law, we’re taking the steps needed to protect our community, our workers and our planet.” The city's report calculated that exporting millions of tons of coal annually through the port of <location>Oakland</location> would release significantly more greenhouse gases than produced each year by all five oil refineries in the <location>San Francisco</location> <location>California</location>.And the report noted that <location>Oakland</location> was especially vulnerable to rising sea levels.The ban is the second blow for the coal industry on the <location>West Coast</location> in recent weeks.In May, the army of <location>United States</location> denied a permit for a coal terminal planned 90 miles north of <location>Seattle</location> on the grounds that it would endanger wildlife.
