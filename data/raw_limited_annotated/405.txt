The report, which was prepared by Claudia Cappio, an assistant city administrator, warned of the risks of cancer, heart and lung ailments and childhood developmental problems resulting from exposure to what it called “fugitive dust emissions” — the airborne particles generated from handling, transporting and loading coal onto ships.The coal would have been shipped from <location>Utah</location> and other western states to the bulk and terminal, which is on an abandoned Army base across the bay from <location>San Francisco</location>.The lead investor in the project, Phil Yagami, the chief executive and president of <location>California</location> capital and Investment Group, warned in an email of “legal consequences” from the decision.“Exactly how much of the city's limited resources and how many jobs for West oaklanders are this Council willing to sacrifice on this crusade?” he asked.Mr. Yagami is one of the most prominent developers in <location>Oakland</location> and is a friend and political supporter of <location>California’s</location> governor, Jerry Brown, a former mayor of the city.A lawyer for Mr. Yagami, David Smith of the firm Stice & Block, wrote in a letter to the Council before the vote that a ban would be a “pronouncement to the world that <location>Oakland</location> is not a trustworthy or reliable place to invest or do business.” Mr. Smith called the argument that coal exported from <location>Oakland</location> would increase the emissions of greenhouse gases “nonsensical and absurd” because power plants overseas would burn coal from somewhere else if they did not get coal from the <location>Oakland</location> port.Mr. Smith also asked whether the concern over the global consequences of coal would apply to other goods that move through the city and its ports.“Under this approach, the city would have to hold gas station owners responsible for greenhouse gas emissions from cars that refuel at their facility,” he said.The vote comes at a time when <location>Oakland</location> is increasingly shifting toward technology jobs — and away from the city’s blue-collar heritage.The streaming music service, is based in <location>Oakland</location>, and Uber is moving its headquarters there next year.
