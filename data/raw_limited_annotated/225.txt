Just for the Fourth of July, Yankee Red Hots sausages are being sold to take home from Pig Beach, a seasonal, mostly outdoor restaurant serving smoked meat overlooking the <location>Gowanus Canal</location> in <location>Brooklyn</location>.The links are made in-house from pork riddled with bits of provolone and pickled hot cherry peppers.
