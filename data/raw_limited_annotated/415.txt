Part of the reason berries sink in a butter cake is because there is plenty of room underneath them in a standard cake pan.In a shallower pan, there’s no place to fall.A 10-inch tart pan worked perfectly.The berries stayed on top of the batter, collapsing only minimally and retaining their color and shape.And the cake surrounding them was still soft and velvety.Because I’d envisioned this cake as the finale to a Fourth of July barbecue, I formed the berries into patriotic strawberry, raspberry and blueberry stripes, adding a sprinkle of confectioners’ sugar and a dollop of whipped cream, the white to go with all that red and blue.But feel free to lay your berries in any shape you like — stars, smiley faces, rhombuses.Other fruit works well, too, if you’ve got plums or nectarines instead of berries.Then be sure to serve this cake on the same day that it’s baked.Leftovers will make for a rather soggy breakfast the next day.And that is a sad cake moment you ought to avoid.Recipes: Buckwheat Berry Striped Cake | Fourth of July
