When Ali was told he had Parkinson’s, it must have been a blow that stung him harder than any in his life.He cherished the sound of his own voice and loved the way his body moved.And, of course, he always talked about how pretty he looked.Yet he didn’t disappear from sight.He showed up — body stiff, face frozen and left hand shaking out of control — to light the caldron in <location>Atlanta</location>.The once invincible man wasn’t shy about showing that he wasn’t invincible after all.I know how hard that must have been for him because my father, Zbigniew, was entering the final stage of Parkinson’s when he died in November.I always considered my father the toughest man I knew, but never more than when I saw him — razor blade in one hand, one Parkinson’s pill in another — as he sliced the pill into wafer-thin segments.My dad knew that over time, his body wouldn’t respond to the medicine, especially as the doses increased.So he had tried to take control of what was happening by limiting himself to what would barely get him through his rough days, even though it would make his current days much rougher.He never stopped fighting.For Summitt, having dementia could be embarrassing, especially for a woman whose sharp thinking helped her win games.But that didn’t seem to matter to her.She still looked for the spotlight, unafraid to describe what dementia had done to her and how she was coping with the changes.Summitt was in a battle she could never win, but she still could make a difference for others by educating them about the disease.She spoke about her dementia in interviews, and also in her 2013 book, “sum It Up,” in which she also talked about another issue that is often taboo to speak about — the six miscarriages she had before giving birth to her son, Tyler.She accepted the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2012 ESPYs, where she gave a short speech, saying, “It’s time to fight.” Soon after her diagnosis, she started the Pat Summitt Foundation, and its mission was to find a cure for Alzheimer’s.At the end of our telephone conversation nearly 20 years ago, Summitt spoke about the importance of women in sports.She told me she was glad I was training to be a sports reporter because there needed to be more women writing about sports.I wondered why she had taken the time for me.Now I know.Summitt wanted to make a difference in this world, both on and off the basketball court.That’s exactly what she did.
