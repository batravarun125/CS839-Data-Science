How to do this will be the focus of the second day of the summit meeting on Wednesday — from which Mr. Cameron is excluded.The shock vote in <location>Britain</location> has done more than embolden populists who denounce the European Union as a distant and meddling force.It has resurfaced deep bitterness and anger left by earlier crises, notably a grinding economic slowdown and an uncontrolled influx of migrants across <location>Europe</location> open borders.Instead of dealing with just the crisis of confidence set off by the vote for Brexit, leaders are effectively confronting all the crises of recent years at one time.Still unresolved are arguments over austerity, the German-led prescription for a financial crisis that began in <location>Greece</location> in 2008, and whether the European Union should be merely a free-trade zone or the locomotive of a more ambitious program of “ever closer union,” a cause enshrined in the 1957 treaty.Arriving for the summit meeting, Prime Minister Alexis of <location>Greece</location> — whose country voted in a referendum last year to reject a financial bailout offered by <location>Brussels</location> only to accept even harsher terms to avoid expulsion from <location>Europe’s</location> common currency — described the British referendum result as a “sad wake-up call” that should force the European Union to abandon policies of austerity and “endless negotiations behind closed doors.” At the European Parliament early on Tuesday, a debate on Britain’s referendum result produced raucous scenes as Nigel Farage, a British member of the assembly and a driving force behind the Brexit campaign, traded insults and mockery with fellow legislators and the president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, Jean-Claude Juncker, who demanded to know: “Why are you here?” Mindful that <location>Europe’s</location> identity crisis is unlikely to be settled anytime soon, the leaders of the <location>Poland</location> and <location>Slovakia</location> urged the European Union to “get back to basics” and focus on reinforcing freedoms and building a single market.“Instead of endless theoretical debates on ‘more’ or ‘less’ we need to focus on ‘better,’” the leaders of the four countries, all formerly communist, said in a statement.What this “better” — a popular slogan now used by politicians who agree on little else — would look like exactly is unclear.What is clear, however, is that skepticism over the European Union as it works now is on the rise.A spring survey by the Pew Research Center found that while support for the bloc remains strong in <location>Poland</location> and <location>Hungary</location>, which have benefited greatly from infusions of funds from <location>Brussels</location>, just 27 percent of Greek, 38 percent of French and 47 percent of <location>Spanish</location> citizens hold a favorable view.Positive views of the European Union fell, often substantially, in five of the six countries surveyed by Pew in both 2015 and 2016.Even <location>Germany</location>, where strong support for the so-called European project had been an unwavering feature of postwar politics, euroskepticism is on the rise, with 48 percent of those polled saying they had an unfavorable view of the bloc.Speaking as he arrived for the summit meeting, President François Hollande of <location>France</location> said the situation today in the <location>United Kingdom,</location> with political turmoil, a plunging currency and credit rating downgrades, should alert other Europeans of the need to stick together.“Many people today are asking the same question,” he said.“What do we do if confronted by the same choice” British voters faced.The question of when <location>Britain</location> will invoke Article 50, opening negotiations, has dominated discussion in <location>London</location> and some other capitals, but has left some leaders cold.“I think it’s utterly disappointing that, when we are faced with the biggest political crisis in the history of the European Union, what’s grabbing the headlines is the obscure Article 50,” Joseph Muscat, the prime minister of <location>Malta</location>, said in <location>Brussels</location>.The far more important issue, he said, is “that this is a <location>Europe</location> that people are feeling increasingly estranged from and that it is our duty that we take action.”
