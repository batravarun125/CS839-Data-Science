Congressional Republicans have largely been quiet about one of their signature economic issues — free trade — since Donald J. Trump’s ascent this spring.But <location>Britain’s</location> vote to leave the European Union has given them a new, if narrow, opening.Even as Mr. Trump was back to criticizing free-trade deals in a speech in <location>Pennsylvania</location> on Tuesday, Republicans were dipping their toes back in the topic.In a radio interview in his home state of <location>Wisconsin</location>, the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, a longtime and vocal proponent of free trade, suggested that the <location>United States</location> and <location>England</location> needed to make a bilateral trade agreement once the country formally separated from the European Union.“We would probably want to put together our own trade agreement with <location>Great Britain</location>, which would be easier to do, actually,” Mr. Ryan said.
