<location>BRUSSELS</location> — Less than 24 hours after <location>Britain</location> threw <location>Europe’s</location> postwar order into disarray last Thursday by voting to leave the European Union, dozens of officials from the bloc’s 28 member countries and its executive arm met behind closed doors in a drab <location>Brussels</location> office block to discuss the urgent issues at hand.The meeting ended without a decision, however, and was followed on Monday by more inconclusive and confidential wrangling in the Albert Borschette Congress Center in <location>Brussels</location>.The main issue under discussion was not Brexit, as <location>Britain’s</location> departure from the bloc is called, but another divisive cause embraced by British foes of the European Union: the freedom to use certain types of weed killer.While <location>Berlin</location>, <location>Europe’s</location> de facto capital, has hosted crisis meetings in recent days to discuss how to respond to <location>Britain’s</location> vote, <location>Brussels</location>, the putative capital of <location>Europe</location>, has stuck doggedly to its own stately rhythms.On Friday and Monday, it plowed ahead with arcane debates about weeds, fish, organic farming and other subjects that have come to form the substance of the so-called European project.This scrutiny of technical minutiae has turned the European Union into a regulatory superpower, allowing it to help set norms and standards used around the world.But that tight focus has crippled its ability to grapple with big issues or to engage with many ordinary people.As the British vote showed, many people feel no connection with what began as an idealistic peace project after World War II, but is now widely viewed as a meddling and undemocratic bureaucratic machine.One thing many in <location>Brussels</location> now agree on is that something has to change in the way the European Union works.But deciding what that is, exactly, will not happen swiftly, Frans Timmermans, the first vice president of the bloc’s executive body, the European Commission, cautioned Monday in a post on Facebook.“The Brexit vote is not an isolated incident and is not just about <location>Europe</location>,” Mr. Timmermans wrote.“It is also about a broad sentiment in Western societies that we have lost control of our destinies.” The search for some sort of answer will start on Tuesday at a previously scheduled two-day summit meeting of European leaders.It will be the first full gathering of the leaders, including the British prime minister, David Cameron, since last Thursday’s referendum.The group will consider for the first time how to respond to the British vote.But the leaders will do so only after sticking to the original agenda focused on migration, investment and other matters.The all-important discussion will be squeezed into a dinner attended by Mr. Cameron and other leaders on Tuesday.The British leader will then be excluded from the second day of the summit meeting when leaders of the 27 remaining countries will begin assessing the future direction of the bloc without <location>Britain</location>.Founded on the premise that countries, including former enemies, can and must work in harmony, the European Union, with its elaborate machinery of consensus-driven decision making, instinctively recoils from any public airing of the bloc’s anxieties and deep divisions.“The E.U.was not set up as a crisis-management organization, but now it obviously has to become one,” said Paul Adamson, a longtime British lobbyist based in <location>Brussels</location> and founder of E!Sharp, an online magazine devoted to European affairs.Like nearly all Britons in <location>Brussels</location>, Mr. Adamson said he was stunned and angered by the victory for opponents of the European Union.“We are all in shock and trying to come with terms with what happened,” he said.He added that “there is still a lot to play for,” including the possibility that <location>Britain</location> might decide not to quit after all, or opt for a close association agreement that would be tantamount to staying.About the only Britons celebrating in <location>Brussels</location> are the 24 members of the European Parliament from the Independence Party, or UKIP, a driving force behind the Brexit campaign.
