Majd al Waheidi is a <location>Gaza</location> based “stringer,” a freelance reporter who regularly contributes to The Times.In this piece, she describes a recent — and, for her, a rare — trip to <location>Israel</location>.As a reporter, I have come to know the Gazan borders very intimately.I once made several reporting trips to a village near the fence for a story about illegal crossings.But though I live so close to <location>Israel</location>, it is a world away for me.Last month, I crossed the border and left <location>Gaza</location> for only the third time in my life.I was traveling to <location>Israel</location> to obtain a visa for a summer fellowship in <location>Washington</location>  Security on the Gazan side of the border consists of two separate checkpoints: the first (which Gazans call “44”) is controlled by Hamas, and the second (“55”) is controlled by the Palestinian Authority.“44” and “55” are within half a mile of each other, but the two checkpoints represent a lingering division among Palestinians — one that I reported on in 2015.The passageway between <location>Israel</location> and <location>Gaza</location> is a long tunnel, enclosed by wires and metal.After passing through “44” and “55,” I was ferried through the tunnel in a tuk-tuk, a small motorized cart with room for two or four people.(My luggage was carried in a separate van.)When crossing here, at <location>Erez</location>, Gazans often post photos of the tunnel on social media to confirm that they’ve made it this far.I took a picture but chose not to share it; it felt unfair to the Gazans who are unable to leave.Next came the Israeli terminal, which resembles a large glass box.After the last war, <location>Israel</location> eased some of their restrictions, and hundreds of Gazans crossed every day.Most of the people who obtained permits were either businessmen or local staff members of international organizations.Fewer than 10 people were sitting on the chairs waiting for the soldier in the glass enclosure to call each name.Many of them were mothers with their children.Most, I assumed, were patients in need of medical treatment.They called me a few minutes after I arrived.An Israeli soldier, sitting on a tall chair behind the glass, gave me my permit and my I.D.It is rare that I see an Israeli in person; <location>Israel</location> withdrew from <location>Gaza</location> in 2005, and I was too young then to remember their presence.However, I witnessed three wars in less than six years.The last one was devastating.I remember the warplanes and F-16s and artillery shells.At <location>Erez</location>, I saw members of the Israeli defense forces, but not the same ones who fought in wars that left people dead and homes destroyed.I saw Israeli soldiers working administrative jobs, soldiers who help people wanting to leave.I used English with them because I felt they wouldn’t understand me otherwise — though they speak Arabic very well.Everyone who has passed through the tunnel has told me the same thing: The moment we leave <location>Gaza</location>, the air changes.It becomes clean.I noticed it, too.After a two-hour cab ride, I arrived at the American consulate in <location>Jerusalem</location>, completed my interview and received my visa.I then had several days to sightsee.I toured <location>Jerusalem</location> and prayed in the Al-Aqsa Mosque — a site of frequent conflict.I visited the Western Wall and watched as people prayed.<location>Jerusalem</location> was bubbling with life: music, spices, perfumes.
