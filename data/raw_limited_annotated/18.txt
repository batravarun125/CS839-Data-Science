We were handed paper copies of decisions as soon as the justice who wrote the majority opinion started to summarize it from the bench in the courtroom upstairs.I raced to my cubicle in the press room, satisfied myself that I understood the basic message of the decision, and called Jill Agostino, an editor and my indispensable collaborator at bureau.I told her which version to use and tweaked the occasional verb.Minutes later, we delivered the news to our readers, news that had been written weeks before.This is no great innovation.Wire services have long prepared multiple versions of their news alerts.And I can’t say this is the way I would choose to do the job.My predecessors went to the courtroom to hear the decisions announced, and they did not write a word until they had read the written decisions with care.Their deadlines were in the early evening, and they wrote for the next day’s paper.But we are a news organization and we have an obligation to deliver the news.After the first version of each article was posted, I promptly added a vote count, a telling quotation or two and a link to the decision.My colleagues Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis, who had been in the courtroom, soon added a sense of what had happened there, focusing especially on the rare oral dissents delivered by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. Then I spent perhaps an hour reading and another 90 minutes writing a full article that was posted in the early afternoon.These were more satisfying to write and added, I hope, the analysis that readers of The Times expect.A second editor, Bill Hamilton, helped me sharpen and expand these middle-game versions of the articles into what aspired to be the authoritative ones for our legacy product, the printed newspaper.The justices did us one small favor this term: Their decisions were clear and conclusive, and they lacked the overlapping partial concurrences and dissents that can make discerning the governing principle elusive.That meant reality turned out to match one of the versions of it I had written ahead of time.
