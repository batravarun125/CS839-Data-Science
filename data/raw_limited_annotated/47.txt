(Given the Lo Lifes’ fraught history with the Ralph Lauren company, the book comes with no official support from Ralph Lauren.)“The first generation, it was straight ’hood,” Mr. DeJesus said.“It was criminal.You’d get robbed.You’d have to rob.” But by the mid-’90s, things were beginning to change.Polo had gained a foothold in hip-hop, and many Lo Lifes had died or were in prison.After completing the last of several prison stints in 1994, he went straight and brought his crew with him.“Once we made that positive transition,” he said, shoplifting “was no longer a requirement in Lo Lifes.” By then, a new generation of fanatics was emerging, though not stealing.“I started meeting people who were living the Lo Life culture,” Mr. DeJesus said.“They had so much more to offer than being gangster from the hood.They had talent, skill, resources: things the founders lacked, things we couldn’t acquire.” Initially there were tensions between the generations, but those have largely been quelled.Nowadays, the community comes together at Polo clothing conventions or annual events like the Lo Life BBQ in <location>Brooklyn</location>, or Lo Goose on the Deuce, a gathering in <location>Times Square</location>.Mr. DeJesus isn’t the Polo obsessive he once was.(“I have children, so they ransacked my collection,” he said.)But he recently released a Lo Life clothing line, riffing on vintage Polo motifs.“Bury Me” ends up as a vibrant capstone to a devoted life, though.It unites all the demographics: the boosters, the rappers, the collectors.“You have to respect the new generation and embrace them,” Mr. DeJesus said.“Without the new generation, you would just be a story of the past.”
