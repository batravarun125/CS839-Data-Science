Other factors that affect their disease-spreading potential include feeding habits, where they lay eggs and the density of the infected population compared with the human population.And only female mosquitoes bite.Here are six of the most common disease-spreading offenders endemic to the <location>United States</location>.An intensely black mosquito, distinguishable by its pointed abdomen and two white stripes in the shape of a lyre on its back (the dorsal thorax), and white bands on its legs.They primarily bite humans, rather than other animals, and they like to feed indoors.The combination makes them particularly dangerous when it comes to spreading disease.They are also fidgety.They will eat several partial meals on multiple victims, called sip-feeding.It is one way they pass pathogens.Females draw blood to nourish their eggs.They prefer to lay them in clean water, including birdbaths, clogged gutters, pet bowls, bottle caps and even shower drains.The eggs stick to the sides of containers and can survive drying out.Most cases of Zika, which can cause debilitating birth defects including microcephaly, have been transmitted through this aggressive insect.It can also carry the viruses that cause dengue fever, chikungunya and yellow fever.The species rarely flies more than a block in its lifetime.But it has been found in <location>New Jersey</location>, southern <location>Connecticut</location> and <location>New York</location> city, though not necessarily in large populations.But the C.D.C.is focusing its mosquito control efforts more broadly in <location>California</location>, <location>Texas</location>, <location>Florida</location>, <location>Arizona</location> and <location>Louisiana</location>, which have high population densities and a high number of travelers coming in from areas with Zika, two factors that increase the likelihood of local transmission.
