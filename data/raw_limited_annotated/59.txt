at the time, Walter Kennedy, invalidated that contract, arguing that Haywood was not eligible because he was not yet four years out of high school.Haywood would have been eligible to play that June.Haywood, joined by the SuperSonics, sued the N.B.A., claiming that the league’s threatened penalties against him and Schulman for not following the draft rules violated antitrust law.Haywood had been playing in the rival American Basketball Association for the Rockets, who had drafted Haywood under a hardship exemption after his second year at the University of <location>Detroit</location>.In 1971, after a blizzard of appeals and injunctions, the Supreme Court ruled by 7 to 2 in Haywood’s favor.Haywood was a Sonic — and in the N.B.A.The N.B.A.and Schulman settled out of court.Schulman paid a fine and legal costs.But Haywood won.Haywood’s move for officially changing the name of the rule might be misinterpreted as the egotism of a former player who wants to remain relevant.In fact, Haywood’s stance is the legitimate argument of a Hall of Fame player whose legacy changed the course of a league and many of its players — for the better.Haywood’s triumph was a victory for the N.B.A.as well.The league’s argument about the potential harm arising from a flood of young players was laughable.The Spencer Haywood rule allowed the N.B.A.to expand.The league gained access to an ever deepening pool of supple young bodies.Over the next 15 years, some of the greatest players in history left college early — thanks to Haywood.Bernard King, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Isiah Thomas, Allen Iverson, James Worthy, Dominique Wilkins, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone.“They won, even though they lost,” Haywood said of the league.A result of the Haywood lawsuit was that the N.B.A.instituted an exception for players who could demonstrate economic hardship if they were made to wait four years after high school.In 1976, the hardship requirement was scrapped in favor of what appeared to be a completely noneconomic standard, which was early entry in exchange for ineligibility to play college basketball.But the age of the league’s labor pool remains an issue.The league may push a proposal that would compel players who accept scholarships to play two seasons in college before being eligible for the draft.When we spoke after Sunday’s screening, Haywood said he was disappointed that none of the players had stayed to watch the film.“I was really hurt,” he said.After the screening, the union’s executive director, Michele A. Roberts, perhaps sensing Haywood’s disappointment, assured Haywood that the players did appreciate what he had done, even if none of them stayed to watch the film.In any event, if I were Haywood, I would not care whether the players watched the movie.I’d rather they showed their gratitude by voting to change the name of the rule under which many of them gained entry into the N.B.A.Haywood took on the N.B.A.— and won.Call it what it is: the Spencer Haywood rule.
