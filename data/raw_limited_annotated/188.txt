Conservatives thought this Supreme Court term would be different.Still reeling from losses last year in major cases on health care and same-sex marriage, they welcomed a new docket in October studded with cases that seemed poised to move the law to the right.But then came two unexpected turns of events.Justice Antonin Scalia, the longest-serving member of the court’s five-justice conservative wing, died.And Justice Anthony M. Kennedy veered left in two of the term’s biggest cases, joining the court’s liberals in significant decisions favoring affirmative action and abortion rights.For the second term in a row, the court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. delivered liberal decisions at a rate not seen since the famously liberal court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s and 1960s.Yet the court, which ended its term on Monday, remains in a period of great transition.With one vacant seat and the possibility of more to come, it is almost certainly entering a new era, the shape of which will depend on the outcome of the presidential election.For now, Justice Scalia’s absence has handed Chief Justice Roberts the difficult task of steering his colleagues toward consensus in big cases.Over the past term, when he succeeded the resulting decisions were sometimes so narrow that they barely qualified as rulings.When he failed, the court either deadlocked or left him in dissent.Before Justice Scalia died, the court had agreed to hear cases that conservative advocacy groups hoped would help business interests and Republican politicians, while dealing setbacks to public unions, colleges with racial admissions preferences and abortion providers.Just four days before his death, the court seemed to send an assertive signal, blocking the Obama administration’s effort to combat global warming by regulating emissions from coal-fired power plants.The vote was 5 to 4, with the court’s conservatives in the majority.Things soon changed.Justice Scalia’s death left the court’s eight remaining members evenly divided along ideological lines, and a case that had threatened to cripple public union, No.14-915, illustrates the impact of his absence.When it was argued in January, a month before Justice Scalia died, the court’s conservatives seemed ready to say that forcing public workers to support unions they have declined to join violates the First Amendment.Soon after the argument, the publicly available evidence indicates, Chief Justice Roberts assigned the majority opinion to Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who in two earlier opinions had made clear that he was ready to overturn a 1977 decision allowing such unions to require the payments.But in March, the month after Justice Scalia died, the court announced that it had deadlocked in the case.As is the custom, the brief order gave no reasons and did not say how the justices had voted.The decision left the 1977 precedent in place.But it could have been worse for the president.While the tie vote left in place an appeals court decision blocking the effort, Justice Scalia, if he had been alive, would almost certainly have provided the fifth vote for a comprehensive rebuke to what Republicans say is a pattern of unconstitutional overreach by Mr. Obama.The alternative to a deadlock was sometimes a muddle.In May, the court unanimously returned a major case on access to contraception, Zubik v. Burwell, No.14-1418, to the lower courts for further consideration in the hope that the two sides could somehow settle their differences.“The court expresses no view on the merits” of the case, the unsigned opinion said.If an eight-member court was deadlocked or toothless, it turned out that a seven-member court was prepared to take a major step.
