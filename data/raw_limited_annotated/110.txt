Just in time for the couture shows next week — couture being, perhaps, the original customization art in fashion, the one in which a customer goes to the atelier, chooses her dress and then, because it is being made for her only, has it altered as she so desires — Jimmy Choo is planning to unveil its latest innovation: not a new heel height or shape, but a collection of crystal clip-ons, buttons and bracelets that can decorate pumps and clutches and peep-toe ankle-laced stilettos (even slip-on skater shoes), the better to luxe up an otherwise simple pair of shoes according to individual desire.“People really want to show their personality, and have something a little different,” said Sandra Choi, Jimmy Choo’s creative director.This follows the introduction of Gucci Do it yourself stage 2, a service in the brand’s flagship store in <location>Milan</location> that allows customization of jackets, tuxedos, coats and shoes.Then there’s Opening Ceremony’s new “embroidery station,” a sewing machine tucked away in the soho store where customers can personalize shirts and jackets with patches and graphics.The service will soon expand to hand-painting, airbrushing and hand embroidery.We are entering an era of fashion Do it yourself.Not do-it-yourself (we’ve all been there, got the tie-dyed T-shirt), but design-it-yourself.If personalization has been a growing phenomenon for a while now, with brands from Ralph Lauren to Nike and Fendi offering products for the tweaking, these programs take the practice to another level, empowering customers to make their mark on their clothing in a more elemental, and idiosyncratic, way.Many industry insiders think it is just the beginning.Ask about the future of fashion, and the answer that is likely to come back (along with the importance of and the transformation of shows into entertainment) is personalization.After all, if you have one pair of sneakers from a designer, you don’t necessarily need another.But if you can take that pair and make it special by designing it yourself, in a way that theoretically at least no one else would do — well, then, there’s a reason to buy another pair, isn’t there?We live in a world where individuals are increasingly encouraged to take charge of their own fate and challenge the authority of the institution: medically, educationally and now sartorially.The age of designer dictates is over; this is the dawn of designer humility.Consider Alessandro Michele’s rationale for his Gucci service: “The way you dress is really the way you feel, the way you live, what you read, your choices.That’s what I want to put into Gucci and that’s why I decided to give our customers the possibility of customizing and creating their own Gucci products.” But there is a fine line between giving consumers a voice and facilitating cacophony.Before everyone gets carried away and rushes down to seize power for themselves and start decorating, it is worth pausing and acknowledging that there is a risk to all this.Not just in making a bad color choice — after all, there is a reason designers are designers and the rest of us are not: They have an understanding of fabrics and colors and what works and what does not, that has been honed over time — but in revealing your own lapses in taste or judgment.We all have embarrassing clothing choices hidden away in our closet.Do it yourself simply ups the ante.This was brought home to me a few years ago when I designed my own Fendi Peekaboo bag for an article.
