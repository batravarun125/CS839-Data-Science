Paul Draper, who as winemaker and chief executive has led Ridge Vineyards for more than 45 years as it became one of the world’s most celebrated wine producers, is retiring, Ridge will announce on Wednesday.Mr. Draper, who turned 80 this year, will hand over responsibilities to a team of executives who have been with Ridge for decades.Mr. Draper will continue as chairman of the board to oversee the transition.The executives who will succeed him — Mark Vernon, Eric Baugher, John Olney and David Gates — have already been running day-to-day operations there for some time.“The wines of the last 10 years are theirs, not mine,” Mr. Draper said in a statement, “so you already know the quality and style of the vintages to come.” Ridge is best known for its excellent zinfandel-based wines, primarily from two <location>Sonoma</location> county sources, and in <location>Geyserville</location>, which have always emphasized the characteristics of their sites over power and intensity.But its greatest wine is monte bello, a cabernet sauvignon-based blend produced in the historic monte bello vineyard high on a ridge in the <location>Santa Cruz</location>.Since Mr. Draper took charge of the winemaking at Ridge in 1969, the quality and style of monte bello has been remarkably consistent, even as prevailing wine styles shifted radically in the 1990s.Back then, the critical spotlight focused on a handful of new <location>Napa Valley</location> producers who charged exorbitant prices for their tiny production.They made wines that blended the <location>Bordeaux</location> grapes, primarily cabernet sauvignon, in a new and different style, emphasizing power and fruity impact over finesse.But under Mr. Draper, Ridge did not deviate from its course.Vintage after vintage, monte bellos reflected both the vineyard site and the Ridge style of making wines that were intended to age, develop complexity and accompany food.
