 Summer isn’t the busiest time for buzzy hotel openings.According to Kristen Korey Pike, who owns the <location>Atlanta</location> travel consultancy KK Travels Worldwide, many splashy properties tend to debut in the fall.That said, there are some noteworthy lodgings that will be open for business as of this summer.Below is a list of five we’ve gathered from hotel industry experts.Mercer Hotel, <location>Spain</location>  Opening: Early September From a <location>Barcelona</location>-based hotelier, Pedro Molina, the Mercer Hotel is aiming to offer the most luxe accommodations in <location>Seville</location>, a city with a dearth of upscale hotels.Situated in an early 19th-century building in the heart of town, in the lively <location>Arenal</location> neighborhood and near palace, the property has just 12 rooms, all with sleek, contemporary furnishings.There’s also a rooftop terrace, a pool, a cocktail bar and a light-filled courtyard where guests can enjoy breakfast in the morning and drinks throughout the day.“<location>Seville</location> is challenging when it comes to finding upscale lodgings so this hotel has the potential to really change the game,” said Jean Pickard, a travel consultant at SmartFlyer in <location>Atlanta</location>.Prices from 500 euros.Anantara Al Jabal Al Akhdar Resort,<location>Oman</location>  Opening: Late August This hotel, according to Ms. Pike, will open up an area of <location>Oman</location> that travelers know little about.“It’s an absolutely gorgeous part <location>Asia</location>, and because it’s in the mountains, it enjoys a cooler climate than the rest of the region,” she said.The 115-room resort, from the <location>Bangkok</location>-based hospitality brand Anantara, is perched more than 6,500 feet above sea level and has three pools including one for children; a cooking school, Spice Spoon, that specializes in Omani and Thai food; a spa with a hammam; and eight different dining options including the <location>Omani</location> restaurant Al Qalaa.
