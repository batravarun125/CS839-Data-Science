But he took over responsibility for day-to-day operations that year as the company’s problems escalated, and its board named him to succeed a Swiss executive, Stefan Stocker, who was then its president.Few seem to believe that Takata can weather the recall crisis on its own.The company lost 13 billion yen last year, or about $127 million, and had just ¥54 billion in cash reserves as of the end of March, against recall costs that specialists say may ultimately exceed ¥1 trillion.A committee of lawyers and other corporate-restructuring advisers appointed by the company this year said it risked bankruptcy if it did not find a rescue, and last month Takata hired the American investment bank Lazard to lead the search.Takata and its bankers have held discussions with a range of potential white knights, according to news reports, including the American buyout fund KKR & Company, formerly Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and a Chinese car parts maker, Ningbo Joyson.Japanese automakers and banks, as well as the Japanese government, are also seen as potential contributors to a bailout.The most crucial question for Takata, specialists say, is how much of the recall costs will ultimately be borne by its automaker customers, rather than by the company itself.Fourteen carmakers have been affected by the airbag problem, in which the devices’ inflaters can explode with too much force, sending shrapnel flying into a vehicle’s cabin.The latest deadly incident, a crash on Saturday in <location>Malaysia</location> that killed a 44-year-old woman, involved a 2005 Honda City.The model had been recalled, but the vehicle had not been taken in to have the airbag component replaced, according to a spokesman for Honda Motor.In the most recent report on the airbag problem last month, safety regulators in the <location>United States</location> said prolonged exposure to environmental moisture and wide temperature fluctuations could degrade the propellant that Takata used in its inflaters, making it unstable and prone to unexpectedly exploding.Based on the finding, which was consistent with theories put forward by engineers and other specialists, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ordered Takata to work with automakers to recall an additional 35 million to 40 million airbags, bringing the number recalled in the <location>United States</location> to nearly 64 million.Carmakers have paid most of the bills for repairing defective airbags so far.They can try to recoup costs from Takata, but the amount is negotiable and subject to complicated calculations.Forcing Takata to repay the full cost would almost certainly bankrupt the company, depriving carmakers of a supplier that, for all its problems, is crucial to keeping their assembly lines running.Takata is one of just three major airbag manufacturers worldwide and controls 25 percent to 30 percent of the market, according to industry researchers.And cost sharing is vital to finding a savior for Takata: The more the recall costs are absorbed by carmakers, the more attractive Takata will look to potential investors.The intricate negotiations over cost sharing, which involve Takata, carmakers, potential investors and Japanese banks that have lent Takata money, are expected to take months.“There’s KKR, other funds, companies from <location>China</location>, <location>Japan</location>, <location>America</location>, maybe <location>India</location> — 20 or 30 companies are interested,” Mr. Endo said.“It all depends on the cost split.We’re likely to see a very complex structure that limits any one party’s responsibility.”
