<location>Britain’s</location> political leadership has frayed at the top, and stunned European Union leaders are anxiously responding to British voters’ decision to leave the bloc.Here is the latest: Jeremy Corbyn Loses Labour Party Vote The head of the opposition Labour Party lost a leadership vote of party lawmakers Tuesday, 172 to 40.The no-confidence vote does not change Mr. Corbyn’s status, but it opens him up to a leadership challenge at a time when the party must prepare for a possible general election.Mr. Corbyn was never as popular among Labour lawmakers as he was with the party’s membership.The so-called Brexit vote further undermined his authority, much as it cost Prime Minister David Cameron his job.The vote last week to leave the European Union — creating more questions about <location>Britain’s</location> future than answers — has created a chain reaction that has left the country with a lame-duck government and no viable opposition.An Emotional Response in <location>Brussels</location> across <location>Europe</location> responded Tuesday with a mix of anxiety and defiance, even as the bloc’s bureaucratic apparatus in <location>Brussels</location> puttered on.Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said Tuesday that he felt sad over the decision by British voters.“I felt as if someone very close to me had left our home, and in the same second I felt also how dear and precious this home was to me.” Chancellor Angela Merkel of <location>Germany</location> said she would use “all her strength” to preserve the European Union, and quashed any idea of exploring special arrangements for <location>Britain</location>.“Whoever wants to leave this family cannot expect to have no more obligations but to keep the privileges,” she said Tuesday.
