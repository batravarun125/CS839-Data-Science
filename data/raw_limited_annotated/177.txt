In a deal with federal regulators, Ikea announced Tuesday that it would recall 29 million chests and dressers in the <location>United States</location> after at least six toddlers were crushed to death in tip-over accidents.The move by the Swedish company, the world’s largest furniture seller, represented a crucial victory for consumer advocates in a yearslong effort to hold it accountable for a growing death toll of young children dating to 1989.The head of the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a stark warning to owners of furniture included in the recall.“If you have or think you have one of these products, act immediately,” the commission’s chairman, Elliot F. Kaye, said in a statement.“It is simply too dangerous to have the recalled furniture in your home unanchored, especially if you have young children.” Alan M. Feldman, a <location>Philadelphia</location> lawyer who is representing three of the families of toddlers in lawsuits against Ikea, said he welcomed the recall, but wished it had been issued much sooner.(He also said that the commission on Tuesday failed to note the death of a 3-year-old girl that was blamed on Ikea furniture in 2005, raising the toll to at least seven).“I don’t think that we should forget that it took seven deaths and more than 70 injuries and an untold number of near-misses before Ikea was shamed into taking action,” Mr. Feldman said.Lars Petersson, the president and chief executive of <location>USA</location>, said the recalled furniture was never intended to be free-standing, but rather secured to walls with provided straps, a step he called “an integral part of the assembly instructions.” “If you are assembling correctly, the product is actually a very safe product,” he said in an interview on Tuesday.Mr. Petersson declined to comment on the lawsuits brought by families, which accuse the company of knowing about the deadly risks of its furniture and failing to do anything about it.“The death of a child is an incredible loss,” he said.“It should never happen.So our hearts go out to the families that have to go through this.” A child dies, on average, once every two weeks in accidents that involve the toppling of furniture or bulky television sets, according to the safety commission.Every year, about 38,000 people visit emergency rooms for injuries related to tip-over accidents, a majority involving children under 5.
