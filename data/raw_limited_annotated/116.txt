<location>PARIS</location> — “Anything could happen” on the street, the photographer Bill Cunningham said in what would turn out to be one of the final videos he recorded before his death.It was one in which, with customary enthusiasm, he noted a “gale force explosion,” in the vogue for tattered jeans.Observing that one gentleman he had photographed — Kanye West, whom Bill didn’t identify — attended the 2016 Met Gala dressed in laboriously raggedy trousers and a bejeweled Balmain jacket, the seasoned octogenarian took this latest turning in the evolution of costume in stride.“It’s just clothing,” Bill said.“What’s the big deal?” His was a wonderful perspective.By taking the long view, Bill maintained not just a journalist’s necessary detachment but something rarer, an ability to experience with perennial wonder the passing parade.One thought of Bill a great deal during the past weeks — he died Saturday after being hospitalized this month as a result of a stroke — and the pleasure it would be to share with him afterward both laughter and a sense of pleasure afforded by the rich and varied and, not infrequently, wacko things designers sent onto the men’s wear runways this season.Bill would have loved, as did this observer, the sheer improbable beauty of a Comme des Garçons Homme Plus show that took some of the themes and gestures that have preoccupied the Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo over the decades: transparency; the vulnerability of an exposed body; the formality of frock coats contrasted with the inherent intimacy of outer garments made to look like underwear; the use of signifying patterns, like those she deployed Saturday afternoon of the mute classical mouths; and the blankly unseeing eyes created by the Italian artist Piero Fornasetti.Rendering many of the clothes in peekaboo shower-curtain PVC, Ms. Kawakubo bundled the entire enterprise into one of the protest statements she has increasingly made part of her otherwise often gnomic brief.For once, Ms. Kawakubo’s thoughts required little translation.In response to the information barrage so defining of contemporary culture, she referenced Hans Christian Andersen’s 1837 parable of the emperor’s new clothes.It was a child who, in innocence, pointed out what was clear to everyone in the throngs assembled to greet an emperor in his new raiment: his nakedness.Bill Cunningham was no childlike naïf.Not only was he impossible to hoodwink, he stubbornly declined to be party to his own burgeoning myth.For him, heaps of random facts are not equivalent to knowledge.Work is the only verifiable truth.In this he had a lot in common with Ms. Kawakubo, an artist of similarly ornery stripe.But Bill was neither a grouch nor the ascetic people liked to imagine, fashion’s own St. Teresa on her bed of logs.True, he slept for years on a cot in his studio, surrounded by file cabinets.Yet simultaneously he was living a life that, for someone by nature voyeuristic, was of the greatest indulgence.There is categorically no one in <location>New York City</location> who attended as many diverse parties as he did in a given night, often bicycling from one to another and sometimes back again.Once, at a party given at the Plaza Hotel to benefit the American Academy in <location>Rome</location>, Bill waited futile hours for the socialite Daphne Guinness to rise from her table in order to capture her walking in a pair of heelless cantilevered Nina Ricci shoes.Eventually, he gave up and rode home to have a sandwich.Then, determined to get his shot, he bicycled back again to the hotel at 11 p.m., by which time the call of nature had finally forced Ms. Guinness to stand up.
