“There were blood splatters everywhere,” said Eylul Kaya, 37, sitting outside with her 1-year-old son.“I covered my boy’s eyes and we ran out.” As <location>Turkey</location> has faced several deadly terrorist attacks over the past year, Ms. Kaya said, she never thought she would find herself in the middle of one.“We’ve watched these attacks on TV for months, but I never imagined it would happen with so much security in an airport,” she said.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan noted that the bombing came during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and he called for global unity in the fight against terrorism.“Despite paying a heavy price, <location>Turkey</location> has the power, determination and capacity to continue the fight against terrorism until the end,” Mr. Erdogan said in a statement.Mr. Erdogan added: “The bombs that exploded in <location>Istanbul</location> today could have gone off at any airport in any city around the world.Make no mistake: For terrorist organizations, there is no difference between <location>Istanbul</location> and <location>London</location>, <location>Ankara</location> and <location>Berlin</location>, <location>Izmir</location> and <location>Chicago</location>."<location>Turkey</location> has held itself up as an exemplar of a Muslim democracy and has sought to influence the region by reaching out to its Muslim neighbors.Early on, when <location>Syria</location> slipped into civil war in 2011, <location>Turkey</location> pushed for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad and began helping Syrian rebel groups, allowing the transit of fighters and weapons across its territory.<location>Turkey’s</location> Western allies, including the <location>United States</location>, blamed the country’s open-border policy for allowing extremist groups like the Islamic State to become powerful inside <location>Syria</location>, and the chaos has increasingly spilled over in <location>Turkey</location>, with terrorist attacks and waves of refugees.<location>Turkey</location>, a NATO member, has often been at odds with its Western allies over its approach to the region.The <location>United States</location> and others believe that <location>Turkey’s</location> early policy on <location>Syria</location> enabled the growth of the Islamic State, and they have long felt that <location>Turkey</location> was a reluctant partner in fighting the terrorist group.<location>Ankara</location>, the capital, in February — have been attributed to Kurdish militants, which has heightened tensions between <location>Ankara</location> and <location>Washington</location> over the support the <location>United States</location> has given to Syrian Kurdish militants fighting the Islamic State.
