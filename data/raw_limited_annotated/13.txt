Some dealers are choosing to see the bright side, hoping the settlement can help them and Volkswagen turn a corner.“We’re encouraged to get started,” said Alan Brown, owner of a Volkwagen dealership in <location>Lewisville</location>, <location>Texas</location>., who participated in the dealer call with Volkswagen officials.“I think Volkswagen did a good job on a very big, emotional topic.” Others are less upbeat.Jeff Williams, who has a Volkswagen dealership in <location>Lansing</location>, <location>Michigan</location>, and has 17 unsold diesel models in inventory, said he welcomed the settlement for consumers.But he is frustrated by how long the issue has dragged out — and that there is still no specific fix for the vehicles.Mr. Williams is also unhappy that fixing the 2015 diesels cars now in inventory could take months — assuming anyone would want to buy them.Any changes that might bring them into air-quality compliance would probably reduce engine performance and fuel mileage.In settlement documents, the company said it expected to submit proposed fixes for certain models as soon as July 29, but remedies for other cars might not come until early next year.“So we might be selling these things in the spring, when they are more than two years old,” he said.The German company is still facing a federal lawsuit filed by the owner of three Volkswagen dealerships.It seeks compensation for total economic losses suffered by all 600 dealers in the <location>United States</location>, both in terms of slumping vehicle sales and the decline in the value of their franchises.The case, filed in April in Federal District Court for the Northern District of <location>Illinois</location>, complicates an effort by a group of dealers who have been trying to work cooperatively with Volkswagen to win financial support.Jason Kuhn, owner of two Volkswagen dealerships in <location>Tampa</location>, <location>Florida</location>, and a third in <location>Marietta<location>, who has been involved in those dealer talks with the company, said the discussions had been “robust” and a better settlement offer could be offered to dealers soon.But the key, he said, is for Volkswagen to present a way of fixing the diesel models that franchisees have on their lots.Mr. Kuhn estimated that he owns 80 diesel models that cannot be sold without a fix.“That will determine what the impact is” on dealers, Mr. Kuhn said.
