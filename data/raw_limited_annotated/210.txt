<location>BEIJING</location> — For decades, the “Five Heroes of Mountain” have been presented as courageous examples of how the Communist-led Eighth Route Army fought for the Chinese people against the Japanese invaders in World War II.The tale of how the five men fended off Japanese troops atop a mountain peak in <location>Hebei Province</location>, choosing to smash their weapons and leap — three of them to their deaths — rather than surrender, has been memorialized in museums, school textbooks, paintings, plays and movies.They were celebrated across <location>China</location> until a historian, Hong Zhenkuai, challenged the official narrative in two articles published three years ago.But his questioning of what actually happened in 1941 landed him in a lawsuit, and on Monday, a court in <location>Beijing</location> ruled against him.The <location>Beijing</location> district People’s Court said that Mr. Hong, a former executive editor of the history journal Yanhuang Chunqiu, had defamed the heroes, and that he should apologize publicly on websites and news outlets to the sons of two of the five men, who sued Mr. Hong last August.In its verdict, the court wrote that Mr. Hong’s articles failed to portray the five men positively and, “based on insufficient evidence,” cast doubt on the Communist Party’s narrative of events.Among the issues Mr. Hong raised were whether the men jumped from the peak of mountain or a lower level, whether they leapt voluntarily or slipped off the mountain, and the number of casualties.“The national sentiments, historical memories and the national spirit reflected in the five heroes of mountain and their story are important sources and components of modern China’s socialist core values,” the verdict reads.“Thus, it also damages the Chinese nation’s spiritual values.” But Mr. Hong said he disagreed and planned to appeal.“This result was not unexpected,” he said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.“We’ve been seeing the political winds shifting to the left, and leftists want to safeguard so-called red culture.” Mr. Hong said his account on Sina Weibo, a microblogging site, had been disabled, preventing him from publicly expressing his thoughts and opinions.“I’m stripped of my rights to defend myself, and Chinese media doesn’t quote me either,” he said.“The verdict failed to mention any place where I might have falsified or vilified” the five heroes, Mr. Hong said.“My articles were to question the textbook version.I discovered some elements in this narrative run counter to historic facts.” “I did not defame” the five men, he said.In fact, he added, he drew on published accounts by the two survivors, “who appeared in my articles as witnesses — I quoted what they said.” In one of the two articles, which was published on Caijing.com, a news website, Mr. Hong wrote that while it was important for people to respect war heroes who resisted the Japanese invasion, historic truth should be respected, too.
