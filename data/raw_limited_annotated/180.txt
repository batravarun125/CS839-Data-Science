There is plenty not to like in Antonio García Martinez’s <location>Silicon Valley</location> tell-all, “chaos monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure i” (Harper).An author whose biography boasts that he “lives on a 40-foot sailboat on the <location>San Francisco</location>” is not well positioned to lampoon the social mores of the tech culture.The book’s dedication “to all my enemies” who made the oeuvre possible confirms the impression that the blizzard of score-settling that follows is less than balanced.The aphorisms are sometimes lazy, the facts can be sloppy, and the studied cool – all the while insisting that “I am the uncoolest person you will ever meet” – can be grating.I also could definitely have done without learning about Mr. García’s weakness for “strenuous fornication” and drunken romps in the Facebook broom closet.And yet, somehow, “chaos monkeys” manages to be an irresistible and indispensable 360-degree guide to the new technology establishment.Hiding underneath the braggadocio and evisceration of professional nemeses lies the beating heart of a formidable teacher.“chaos monkeys” is likely to attract headlines and interest because of the prominent names and institutions mercilessly described.This is unfortunate.Mr. García may apologize for his pedagogical asides, but these actually form the true core of what is a remarkably learned book.He schools us in three domains worthy of close study.The first half of “chaos monkeys” takes us inside the world of venture capital.After leaving – and litigating with – one early-stage tech company to start another, Mr. García sells out to Twitter, only to immediately abandon his co-founders for Facebook.Along the way, we meet the lawyers, angel investors, venture firms and associated institutions – notably the Y combinator, which plays an outsize role in securing financing from the most prestigious investors – that drive this ecosystem.The second half of “chaos monkeys” takes place at Facebook, and it concerns the handful of dominant companies that have emerged from this start-up culture.These companies (in addition to Facebook, notably Google and Amazon), whose market values start at more than $300 billion, are approaching (or in the case of Apple and Microsoft, managing) middle age.In addition to contrasting their collective ethos with that of the start-up world, “chaos monkeys” touches on the also-rans like Twitter who failed to break into this rarefied plane.Beyond the author’s personal story, what connects the two distinct halves of the book is his area of actual domain expertise: advertising.
