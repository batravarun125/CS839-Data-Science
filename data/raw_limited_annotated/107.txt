<location>WASHINGTON</location> — A widely publicized sit-in by House Democrats.A bipartisan compromise proposal in the Senate.Neither is very likely to lead to any legislative action in Congress on gun safety this year.Election Day is too close, and most of the Republican opposition is too dug in.But the fact that a legislative response remains elusive does not mean there has been no movement on the issue.Members of both parties say they sensed a shift in the gun debate after the mass killing in <location>Orlando</location>, a notable difference in attitude from the reaction on <location>Capitol Hill</location> after previous horrific shootings.Eight Senate Republicans joined with 44 Democrats on a Republican-proposed compromise that would deny people on two different federal watch lists the ability to buy weapons unless they could successfully appeal that decision.Several other Republican senators showed some willingness to accept new restrictions on gun purchases if they could be structured in an acceptable way.A bipartisan companion measure also was introduced in the House.These are incremental steps, but in the gridlocked world of gun control politics, they count for something.One explanation for the change is that Omar Mateen, the <location>Orlando</location> killer, used his legally purchased firearms in the commission of a terrorist act.Some Republicans say they are willing to challenge the mind-set of no new gun control — and the National Rifle Association — in the interest of trying to prevent similar terrorist attacks.Republicans find it much easier to explain enacting gun restrictions to constituents devoted to the Second Amendment if they can frame their position as an act against terrorism.“The Constitution’s a sacred document, but it is not a suicide pact,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of <location>South Carolina</location> and a gun owner.“This is not hard for me.Due process is important, but at the end of the day, we are at war.” To Democrats, any hint of daylight between some Republicans and the nra.is welcome.“For the first time in quite a while you’re seeing some Republicans buck the nra.,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of <location>New York</location>, the No.3 Democrat in the Senate, who is likely to be the Democratic leader next year.
