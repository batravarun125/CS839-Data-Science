With the spread of the Zika virus, the threat posed by the tiny mosquito has been magnified into shark-size proportions.But among the more than 3,000 species of the insect worldwide, only two in the Americans are known carriers of the virus: the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) and the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus).The potential range of the two species in the <location>United States</location> helps explain where Zika could be a threat.The yellow fever mosquito, for instance, prefers the hot and humid climate in <location>Florida</location> and the southeastern part of the country.But it has colonized states as far west as <location>California</location> and <location>Hawaii</location>, and has the potential to live as far north as <location>Connecticut</location> in warmer weather, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Asian tiger mosquito, meanwhile, also favors tropical and subtropical locales but can withstand cooler temperatures, so it can range farther.In summertime, the insect can sometimes even be found in northern states like <location>Maine</location> and <location>Minnesota</location>.Maps showing where the species might survive, notably, exempt the, northern parts of the <location>Madison.</location>  But Zika is not the only disease that mosquitoes can carry.Other threats include virus, dengue fever and various types of encephalitis.In all, there are about 174 species of mosquitoes in the <location>United States</location>, according to Joseph M. Conlon, a retired Navy entomologist who is a technical adviser to the nonprofit American mosquito control association.<location>Texas</location> has the most species, with about 85, and <location>Virginia</location> has the least, with roughly 24.<location>New York</location> city alone has more than 50 species.A vast majority of these species in the <location>United States</location>, Mr. Conlon said, do not transmit any disease.Whether they do depends, in part, on their physiology.Most viruses (and other microorganisms) are simply digested in the mosquito gut along with the blood.But other viruses have evolved to penetrate the mosquitoâ€™s body cavity and migrate to the salivary glands, from which they are injected with salivary fluid when the mosquito feeds.Those are the diseases that mosquitoes can transmit.Certain bacteria, like Wolbachia, have also been shown to interfere with transmission.
