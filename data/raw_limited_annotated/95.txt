(He quit twice when financing ran out.)As chief carver, his priority was refining the facial expressions on the presidents’ 60-foot-high heads.He fixed a foot-deep crack in Jefferson’s lip with a patch and he sculpted Lincoln’s eyes, highlighting the pupils with wedge-shaped granite stones to reflect the light.“I know every line and ridge, each small bump and all the details of that head so well,” he told the Statesman of Yonkers in 1966.In 1941, the elder Borglum died, financing dried up, plans to carve the torsos of the presidents to the waist were abandoned and Del Bianco returned to <location>Port Chester</location>, where his company carved hundreds of tombstones.He died in 1969 at 78 of silicosis, which is caused by inhaling dust from crushed stone.“The doctors were amazed that he lived as long as he lived,” his daughter Gloria told National Public Radio in 2012, “because the dust in his lungs was like a rock.” A campaign by Luigi’s son Caesar to rectify the official oversight began in the late 1980s after he read Rex Allen Smith’s “The Carving” in which his father’s role was ignored.Caesar, who died in 2009, enlisted his nephew Lou.Mr. Gladstone, the author of “Carving a Niche for Himself,” said that was like writing about the Yankees without mentioning Joe DiMaggio.“After years of being dismissive to the family, the agency at last did the right thing,” Mr. Gladstone said.The recognition on Facebook was also welcomed by Joseph Scelsa, the founder and president of the Italian American Museum in <location>Manhattan</location>.“After 25 years, the National Park Service has finally acknowledged that Luigi Del Bianco was in fact the chief carver,” Lou Del Bianco said.“Permanent recognition at the mountain is what we are really after, but this is a breakthrough and a start in the right direction.”
