The piece, written by Kate Crawford, a principal researcher at the Microsoft and co-chairwoman of a White House symposium on society and A.I., points out a number of embarrassing instances in which A.I.programs have made mistakes that if they were made by humans would be obvious examples of racism.It is not clear why these mistakes have happened, but they do serve as a warning that the tech industry will need to scrutinize the digital brains it is creating.As Ms. Crawford writes, “inclusivity matters — from who designs it to who sits on the company boards and which ethical perspectives are included.Otherwise, we risk constructing machine intelligence that mirrors a narrow and privileged vision of society, with its old, familiar biases and stereotypes.”
